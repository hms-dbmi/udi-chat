UBERON:0000948	heart	A myogenic muscular circulatory organ found in the vertebrate cardiovascular system composed of chambers of cardiac muscle. It is the primary circulatory organ.	['chambered heart', 'vertebrate heart']
UBERON:0000956	cerebral cortex	The thin layer of gray matter on the surface of the cerebral hemisphere that develops from the telencephalon. It consists of the neocortex (6 layered cortex or isocortex), the hippocampal formation and the olfactory cortex.	['cortex of cerebral hemisphere']
UBERON:0000992	ovary	The gonad of a female organism which contains germ cells.	['animal ovary', 'female gonad', 'female organism genitalia gonad', 'female organism genitalia gonada', 'female organism reproductive system gonad', 'female organism reproductive system gonada', 'female reproductive system gonad', 'female reproductive system gonada', 'genitalia of female organism gonad', 'genitalia of female organism gonada', 'gonad of female organism genitalia', 'gonad of female organism reproductive system', 'gonad of female reproductive system', 'gonad of genitalia of female organism', 'gonad of reproductive system of female organism', 'gonada of female organism genitalia', 'gonada of female organism reproductive system', 'gonada of female reproductive system', 'gonada of genitalia of female organism', 'gonada of reproductive system of female organism', 'ovum-producing ovary', 'reproductive system of female organism gonad', 'reproductive system of female organism gonada']
UBERON:0001155	colon	A portion of the large intestine before it becomes the rectum. In mammals, the colon is the most part of the large intestine, excluding the vermiform appendix, the rectum and the anal canal.	['large bowel']
UBERON:0001347	white adipose tissue	Connective tissue consisting of fat-storing cells and arranged in lobular groups or along minor blood vessels.	['adipocytus unigutturalis', 'textus adiposus albus', 'unilocular adipose tissue', 'white fat']
UBERON:0001348	brown adipose tissue	A thermogenic form of adipose tissue that is composed of brown adipocytes.	['adipocytus multigutturalis', 'brown fat', 'multilocular adipose tissue', 'textus adiposus fuscus']
UBERON:0001379	vastus lateralis	The Vastus lateralis (Vastus externus) is the largest part of the Quadriceps femoris. It arises by a broad aponeurosis, which is attached to the upper part of the intertrochanteric line, to the anterior and inferior borders of the greater trochanter, to the lateral lip of the gluteal tuberosity, and to the upper half of the lateral lip of the linea aspera; this aponeurosis covers the upper three-fourths of the muscle, and from its deep surface many fibers take origin. A few additional fibers arise from the tendon of the Glut√¶us maximus, and from the lateral intermuscular septum between the Vastus lateralis and short head of the Biceps femoris. The fibers form a large fleshy mass, which is attached to a strong aponeurosis, placed on the deep surface of the lower part of the muscle: this aponeurosis becomes contracted and thickened into a flat tendon inserted into the lateral border of the patella, blending with the Quadriceps femoris tendon, and giving an expansion to the capsule of the knee-joint..	['lateralis', 'vastus lateralis muscle']
UBERON:0001388	gastrocnemius	The most superficial muscle of the triceps surae group, in the posterior portion of the lower hindleg.	['gastrocnemius muscle', 'm. gastrocnemius', 'm.gastrocnemius']
UBERON:0001898	hypothalamus	A specialized brain region of the ventral diencephalon arising near the end of the segmentation period; the embryonic hypothalamic region will give rise to the posterior pituitary gland as well as a number of brain nuclei.. One of the most important functions of the hypothalamus is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland (hypophysis)..	['Hy', 'preoptico-hypothalamic area', 'preoptico-hypothalamic region']
UBERON:0001969	blood plasma	The liquid component of blood, in which erythrocytes are suspended.	['blood plasm', 'plasma', 'portion of blood plasma', 'portion of plasma']

UBERON:0002107	liver	An exocrine gland which secretes bile and functions in metabolism of protein and carbohydrate and fat, synthesizes substances involved in the clotting of the blood, synthesizes vitamin A, detoxifies poisonous substances, stores glycogen, and breaks down worn-out erythrocytes.	[]
UBERON:0002108	small intestine	Subdivision of digestive tract that connects the stomach to the large intestine and is where much of the digestion and absorption of food takes place (with the exception of ruminants). The mammalian small intestine is long and coiled and can be differentiated histologically into: duodenum, jejunem, ileum.	['small bowel', 'small intestine']
UBERON:0002113	kidney	A paired organ of the urinary tract which has the production of urine as its primary function.	[]
UBERON:0002369	adrenal gland	Either of a pair of complex endocrine organs near the anterior medial border of the kidney consisting of a mesodermal cortex that produces glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and androgenic hormones and an ectodermal medulla that produces epinephrine and norepinephrine.	['glandula adrenalis', 'glandula suprarenalis']
UBERON:0004087	vena cava	Any of the veins that carries deoxygenated blood from a part of the body into the right atrium of the heart.	[]
