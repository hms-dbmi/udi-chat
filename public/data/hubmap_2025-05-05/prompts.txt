Iâ€™m wondering if some organs are harvested from live patients vs dead patients?
Can you show samples by organ and vital status?

is there a relationship between number of cells and storage duration for the samples??

do people of different blood types weight the same?




Demo:

What is the distribution of donor weight?

What about compared to height?

split by sex?

What is the total donor count by sex?


Make a stacked bar chart of donor sex and the cause of death?

display this as a heatmap


(worked but backwards)



What is the total donor count?



X

Facet by cause of death as well.

can you display this in a heatmap?




Demo 2:


What is the total donor count?

What is the distribution of donor weight?

What about compared to height?

and facetted by sex?

How many donors are there for each sex?

Now, show a stacked bar chart of donor cause of death and sex

make this a heatmap
