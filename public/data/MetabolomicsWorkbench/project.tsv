In an IROA protocol, control and experimental samples are isotopically labeled with 95 and 5%13C, and the two sample populations are mixed together for uniform extraction, sample preparation, and LC-MS analysis.To illustrate the utility of IROA for global metabolomics, we exposed wild-type (N2) worms to a heat shock (30 min heat shock at 33 C), which causes significant, widespread changes in metabolism. We collected and analyzed material from the exometabolome (all material that worms release in the supernatant) and the endometabolome (homogenized total extracts from the worm bodies).

Interventions which can stop or even slow the progression of OA are badly needed. The long-term goal of this proposal is to use a metabolomics approach to gain a better understanding of metabolic alterations in people with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and to discover novel biomarkers of disease activity. OA results from progressive destruction of the articular cartilage accompanied by hypertrophic changes in adjacent bone, varying degrees of synovial inflammation, and destruction of other joint tissues, including the menisci and ligaments. There are multiple risk factors for OA, including age and joint injury, but perhaps most relevant to this proposal is the role of obesity. The mechanism by which altered metabolism in certain obese individuals might contribute to OA pathogenesis is poorly understood and will be a subject of this proposal. A second critical need in the OA field, which will be addressed by this study, is the availability of biomarkers to detect early disease, predict which people are more likely to progress, or measure response to therapy. Our general hypothesis for this pilot study is that metabolic differences, measured by a metabolomic analysis of urine samples, can be used to distinguish overweight and obese individuals who develop symptomatic knee OA from those who do not and distinguish those with OA who will progress. To test this hypothesis our specific aims are to: 1) Determine if metabolic differences, detected by a comprehensive metabolomics analysis, can be used to distinguish people who will develop symptomatic knee OA from those who will not and 2) Determine if metabolic differences, detected by a comprehensive metabolomics analysis, distinguish people with knee OA who exhibit radiographic progression during an 18 month exercise and weight loss intervention from those who do not.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000021	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8K01J			Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project	The Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project (JoCo) is a 20+ year ongoing, population-based, prospective cohort study of knee and hip OA designed to be representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized, African American or Caucasian population aged 45 years and older, who were residents of one of 6 townships in Johnston County NC for at least 1 year, and who were physically and mentally capable of completing the studys protocol. All participants had an initial home interview, a clinic examination with radiographs, and a subsequent second home interview. Approximately 3,200 individuals were recruited into the baseline evaluation between 1991 and 1997 (T0); the first follow up visit (T1) occurred from 1999-2004, and the second follow up visit (T2) from 2006-2010. Cohort enrichment (T1*) occurred from 2003-4, allowing new participants to be enrolled; the first follow up for these individuals was at T2. At T0, the sample was approximately 38% men and one-third African American. Between T0 and T1, radiographic knee OA, defined as Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2-4, developed in 12% of knees without knee OA at T0.

This species is unusual in terms of its ease of culture, and its suitability as a laboratory test organism. Studies complementary to this metabolic study have focused on thermal effects on metabolic rates (respiration) and gene expression patterns in this species and do not support Prtners oxygen limitation paradigm. Our purpose here was to examine how an environmentally realistic thermal challenge affects the physiology of this organism.

Within each sub-study, there were three sample matrices except for VG STAT, for which there was only two. For each matrix type within each sub-study 6 samples were analyzed for a total of 18 samples per sub-study (9 of each in VG STAT), the samples were equally divided into STAT/PAT-treated (sub-therapeutic antibiotic treatment (STAT) and therapeutic dose-pulsed antibiotic treatment (PAT)) collected at various time-points versus untreated Controls for each matrix.

Insulin regulates many cellular processes, but the full impact of insulin deficiency on cellular functions remains to be defined. Applying a mass spectrometry-based nontargeted metabolomics approach, we report here alterations of 330 plasma metabolites representing 33 metabolic pathways during an 8-h insulin deprivation in type 1 diabetic individuals. These pathways included those known to be affected by insulin such as glucose, amino acid and lipid metabolism, Krebs cycle, and immune responses and those hitherto unknown to be altered including prostaglandin, arachidonic acid, leukotrienes, neurotransmitters, nucleotides, and anti-inflammatory responses. A significant concordance of metabolome and skeletal muscle transcriptome-based pathways supports an assumption that plasma metabolites are chemical fingerprints of cellular events. Although insulin treatment normalized plasma glucose and many other metabolites, there were 71 metabolites and 24 pathways that differed between nondiabetes and insulin-treated type 1 diabetes. Confirmation of many known pathways altered by insulin using a single blood test offers confidence in the current approach. Future research needs to be focused on newly discovered pathways affected by insulin deficiency and systemic insulin treatment to determine whether they contribute to the high morbidity and mortality in T1D despite insulin treatment.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000045	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M88G6G			Identification of Altered Metabolic Pathways in Plasma and CSF in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease Using Metabolomics	Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) currently affects more than 5 million Americans, with numbers expected to grow dramatically as the population ages. The pathophysiological changes in AD patients begin decades before the onset of dementia, highlighting the urgent need for the development of early diagnostic methods. Compelling data demonstrate that increased levels of amyloid-beta compromise multiple cellular pathways; thus, the investigation of changes in various cellular networks is essential to advance our understanding of early disease mechanisms and to identify novel therapeutic targets. We applied a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based non-targeted metabolomics approach to determine global metabolic changes in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the same individuals with different AD severity. Metabolic profiling detected a total of significantly altered 342 plasma and 351 CSF metabolites, of which 22% were identified. Based on the changes of >150 metabolites, we found 23 altered canonical pathways in plasma and 20 in CSF in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. cognitively normal (CN) individuals with a false discovery rate <0.05. The number of affected pathways increased with disease severity in both fluids. Lysine metabolism in plasma and the Krebs cycle in CSF were significantly affected in MCI vs. CN. Cholesterol and sphingolipids transport was altered in both CSF and plasma of AD vs. CN. Other 30 canonical pathways significantly disturbed in MCI and AD patients included energy metabolism, Krebs cycle, mitochondrial function, neurotransmitter and amino acid metabolism, and lipid biosynthesis. Pathways in plasma that discriminated between all groups included polyamine, lysine, tryptophan metabolism, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; and in CSF involved cortisone and prostaglandin 2 biosynthesis and metabolism. Our data suggest metabolomics could advance our understanding of the early disease mechanisms shared in progression from CN to MCI and to AD.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000046	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M84S36			Metabolomic & lipidomic profiles in response to exogenous insulin & GLP-1 infusions during prolonged fasting	This application requests funding to access state-of-the-art metabolomics and lipidomic platforms at the NIH West Coast Metabolomics Center to analyze plasma samples from recent insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) infusion experiments performed in prolong-fasted elephant seals. This suite of studies was designed to better assess the mechanisms contributing to the onset of an insulin resistantlike condition induced by prolonged food deprivation/starvation in mammals. Because elephant seals have evolved robust physiological mechanisms that have allowed them to naturally tolerate such protracted bouts of fasting, they provide an ideal model to address our central hypothesis that increased lipid utilization late in the fast contributes to insulin resistance in elephant seals. Insulin resistance is a common consequence of fasting in mammals and, while the mechanisms by which it manifests are still unclear, a metabolic shift favoring increased mobilization and utilization of lipids during prolonged food deprivation may be a principal causative factor. Insulin resistance has a negative connotation due to its association with obesity and diabetes among humans, but it has been suggested to be an adaptive response to food deprivation.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000050	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8RG6T			Small cell lung cancer metabolome	The goal of this pilot project is to comprehensively evaluate metabolic underpinnings of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and couple with proteome level measurements of global kinase and other enzyme level expression data to provide insight into the upstream signaling networks that may be driving the pathogenesis of SCLC. Alterations in cancer metabolism are increasingly realized as an emerging area of research and potentially offers new therapeutic strategies. As part of ongoing studies, we are employing a chemical biology platform, activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), to study the SCLC proteome. ABPP uses chemical probes that are directed against the active sites of enzymes to interrogate the functional state of enzymes in biological samples. We used ATP based probes to study differences in kinase and other ATP binding proteins between SCLC and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We used well curated lung cancer cell lines that facilitate functional analysis of key proteins and pathways. Interestingly, our preliminary data strongly implicates hyperactivated metabolic pathways in SCLC when compared to NSCLC cell lines. A strong signal of upregulated metabolic kinases and other proteins involved in glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and purine metabolism have been identified through this approach. However, whether the alterations in the protein levels identified through this proteomic based approach corresponds to altered levels of metabolites through metabolic pathways remains unclear. This new opportunity will allow us to profile SCLC for alterations in metabolism that can be compared to NSCLC. We will conduct metabolomics studies on our SCLC cell lines. Relationships between the underlying alterations in metabolic kinases and other signaling molecules and mechanisms promoting the aggressive phenotype of these SCLC tumors remain unclear. We will collaborate with the NIH Eastern Regional Comprehensive Metabolomics Resource Core at RTI International (RTI RCMRC) to enable metabolomic profiling and analysis of our existing cell lines and tumor tissues.

It is important to understand the genomic and metabolomic changes in breast microenvironment at various stages of cancer development and progression (i.e., normal breast, DCIS, benign disease and invasive cancer). Since intrinsic breast cancer subtypes are very distinct from each other in terms of clinical features as well as the genomic profiling, these subtypes may also have distinct metabolic microenvironment signatures.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000052	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8H01X			Metabonomic profiling of kinase inhibitor response in leukemia	The goal of this pilot project is to develop the metabonomic parameters necessary to comprehensively profile and analyze large numbers of metabolites and their drug-induced responses in cell and animal models of leukemia. Our long-term objective of these studies is to investigate the effects of select kinase inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in an effort to better understand biochemical mechanisms of disease progression and drug resistance. Our focus will be on FLT3-ITD kinase positive models because this is one of the most aggressive and drug-resistant types of AML. Additionally, because of the central role of the MEK/Erk kinase pathway in regulating cell proliferation and survival in these cells, inhibitors of MEK and other kinases will be tested for their effects on human and mouse metabolic profiles. We have developed a unique model of drug-resistant AML and the metabolic response of these cells to kinase inhibitors will also be evaluated. Cells will be treated with kinase inhibitors for varied times, the cells isolated and the cellular metabolites identified and quantified by mass spectrometry and NMR-based analytical methods. Bioinformatics and statistics will be performed and a comprehensive metabonomic analysis of metabolite profiles will be accomplished. Metabonomic responses will be related to specific changes in cell signaling networks. A second major objective will be to perform metabonomic analyses in response to targeted kinase inhibitors in a mouse model of FLT3-ITD AML. We will measure metabonomic profiles in mouse biofluids before and after exposure to MEK inhibitors. The specific effects of MEK or other kinase inhibitors on individual metabolites will be quantified and analyzed by bioinformatics. We anticipate that these studies will lead to the identification of unique sites of intersection between cell signaling and cell metabolism and provide the foundation for future NIH-funded research projects.

NOD Mice (n=71) were assessed as diabetic or non-diabetic based on their fasting (4hr) blood glucose levels at sacrifice, which defined 30 hyperglycemic (glucose = 250 mg/dL) and 41 normoglycemic animals. The primary objective of this study was to identify candidate biomarkers associated with beta-cell destruction/survival and T1D progression.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000055	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M83S3W			Metabolite changes associated with methionine stress sensitivity of cancer	This West Coast Metabolomics Center pilot and feasibility project granted to Peter Kaiser (UC Irvine), aims to achieve understanding of a unique metabolic dependence of cancer cells to explore development of novel unconventional therapeutic strategies that exploit dependence of cancer cells on methyl-donor abundance. The past few years have highlighted the role of altered metabolism in cancer. While mechanistic insight into changed metabolism in cancer is very limited, the importance of the metabolic pathway surrounding homocysteine and methionine for cancer cell proliferation has been known for over 30 years. These findings, generally summarized as methionine-dependence or methionine stress sensitivity, describe the phenomenon that most cancer cells cannot proliferate in growth medium where the amino acid methionine is replaced with its direct metabolic precursor homocysteine. Importantly, non-tumorigenic cells are unaffected by replacing methionine with homocysteine in the growth medium. For the past years we have been studying methionine dependence of breast and prostate cancer and demonstrated that methionine-dependence is caused by insufficient flux through this pathway to sustain synthesis of the downstream metabolite and the principal methyl-donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). We have isolated rare cell clones from MDA-MB468 breast cancer cells (referred to as MB468RES) that are no longer methionine dependent and proliferate in homocysteine medium. Interestingly, MB468RES have lost their ability for anchorage independent growth, a hallmark of cancer. The MB468 and MB468RES cell line pair confirms other observations showing that methionine dependence is tightly linked to tumorigenicity. Importantly, this cell line pair is an ideal model to identify metabolite signatures linked to cancer cell methionine dependence. We propose to characterize the metabolic changes triggered by the shift from normal growth medium to homocysteine medium in MB468 breast cancer cells and the methionine stress insensitive MB468RES derivatives. In addition we have developed cancer cell lines with inducible shRNAs targeting methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), the enzyme catalyzing synthesis of SAM from methionine and ATP. Inducible knockdown of MAT allows us to specifically reduce SAM synthesis. Our previous results suggest that SAM limitation is the critical trigger for cancer cell methionine dependence. Thus metabolite profiling using the MAT knockdown system will provide an independent dataset that together with metabolite profiles from the MB468 and MB468RES cell line pair will define critical metabolic profiles related to cancer cell methionine dependence. In the current investigation, untargeted analysis of primary metabolites and complex lipids, coupled with quantitative analysis of methionine pathway intermediates (folate and respective derivatives, s-adenosylmethoinine, s-adenosylhomocysteine, choline, betaine) and metabolic flux will be conducted on MB468, MB468RES and MB468shRNA following the switch from methionine containing media to homocysteine containing media over the course of 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours. The primary objectives were to 1) characterize the metabolic response to methionine stress and SAM limitation and 2) correlate the metabolic signatures with cancer cell proliferation arrest and death.

In the current investigation, unbiased profiling of the metabolome and lipidome of adipose tissue samples (visceral(VAT) and subcutaenous (SAT)) and serum of 50 CRC patients, including stages I-IV, from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (Seattle,WA) and the German Cancer Research Center (Heidelberg, Germany) was conducted. The lipidome and metabolome of adipose tissue (VAT/SAT) and serum were analyzed using established UPLC-QTOFMS analysis and GC-TOFMS analyses, respectively. The primary objectives of this project were to 1) compare the metabolome and lipidome of matched VAT and SAT adipose tissue of n=50 Colorectal Cancer Cell (CRC) patients, 2) characterize the associations between the lipidome and metabolome in adipose tissue (VAT/SAT) and serum of n=50 CRC patients and 3) test the associations between the lipidome/metabolome of VAT and serum with the tumor stage of CRC patients.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most debilitating disorders in the United States with a 12-month prevalence of 6.7% in the adult population. The disorder affects millions of Americans daily and is a major health concern with enormous economic cost the society at large. Criteria for MDD diagnosis and treatment are based on various signs and symptoms not always fitting into strict diagnostic categories such as DSM-IV. Despite various known risk factors (such as family history, age, and gender), biological markers supporting diagnosis or prediction of MDD are unavailable. We have collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood of more than 600 subjects from the general population. For each of the participants we also obtained biometric information as well as behavioral trait measures. One of the measures is the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a well-established questionnaire for measuring severity of depression. Based on the BDI, roughly 5% of participants suffer from severe depressive symptoms while most of these subjects are not under treatment or receiving any medication for depression In the current investigation, untargeted analysis of primary metabolites was conducted on age and gender matched human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from subjects suffering with MDD ( n=50) and control subjects (n=50). Subjects were diagnosed as having MDD based on the Beck Depression Inventory. The primary objectives of this study were to 1) identify metabolites which discriminate between subjects with and without depression symptoms in the CSF and plasma and 2) how changes correlate between CSF and plasma.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000066	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8QG6H			Metabolomic profiling of influenza: a 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza in lean and obese mice	During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic outbreak, obese individuals were reported to be at greater risk for morbidity and mortality from pandemic infection. However, the mechanisms contributing to greater influenza severity in infected obese individuals remain unclear. Given that one in ten individuals is obese, and worldwide influenza outbreaks are a consistent public health burden, garnering a better understanding of the pathways and mechanisms contributing to greater influenza severity in the obese is essential for limiting influenza infection mortality in this at-risk population. Closely paralleling pH1N1 infection outcome in humans, obese mice exhibit increased morbidity and mortality following pH1N1 infection. In mice, obesity impairs the function of natural killer cells, dendritic cells, macrophage, B cells and memory T cells. Further, several analyses of lung antiviral responses revealed that obese mice have greater lung damage, lung immune cell infiltration and impaired lung healing after infection. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how altered immune cell function contributes to greater lung damage and increased infection severity in obese mice. Metabolomics will be used to dissect the metabolic consequences of obesity on the immune response to pH1N1 infection. We will compare metabolic profiles of lung-specific and peripheral samples from uninfected and infected lean and obese mice during early and late phases of influenza immunity.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000069	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8KS37			Effect of diet and age on ovarian metabolome	The long-term goal of this research is to understand the effects of the Western diet on female reproductive function and aging, to characterize the resultant health consequences and to determine the value of dietary intervention. In the past 100 years, dietary patterns in Western societies have changed remarkably. The consumption of saturated fatty acids (SFA), omega-6 (n-6) unsaturated fatty acids and refined carbohydrates has risen sharply, whereas consumption of fruits, vegetables and omega-3 fatty acids (n-3) has declined. This dietary pattern is associated with post-prandial oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are implicated in numerous disease processes. The key rationale for this pilot grant application stems from studies reporting a decline in reproductive function in women that is coincident with changing patterns of Western diet, observations of Western diet-associated infertility in rodents, and adverse effects of diet on ovarian reserve in monkeys. Recently, ovarian-metabolomic profiling has been used to characterize oxidative and inflammatory pathways in the non-diseased ovary. Using this technology, it has also been reported that aging women, and those with reduced ovarian reserve, have altered follicular fluid levels of carbohydrates and reproductive hormones compared to normal ovarian reserve women. Therefore, this methodology is ideal for determining differences in global metabolomic profiles among ovaries derived from subjects of differing nutritional backgrounds. The proposed study will compare the effects of chronic exposure to a typical Western diet with a prudent diet on ovarian metabolome and metabolites associated with oxidative stress pathways. The central hypothesis is that ovaries from monkeys exposed to markedly divergent nutritional backgrounds will differentiate from each other with respect to their metabolome and with respect to metabolites indicative of oxidative stress. We will address this with three Specific Aims designed to: 1) determine whether the metabolome of ovarian tissue from cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) differentiates by nutritional background; 2) determine if metabolomic profiles of ovarian tissue will differentiate by age in pedigreed, known-age domestic vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) and 3) investigate whether the effects of diet or age on ovarian tissue metabolome is reflected by changes in serum metabolites. Archived ovarian tissue from two well-established nonhuman primate models of women?s health (Macaca fascicularis and Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) will be used for this study.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000071	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8G01M			Genetic effects of high fat diet on mouse fecal metabolomics	We will study expression of a large series of metabolites in fecal samples from a genetically diverse set of mouse strains (BXD type). Separate cohorts of animals are maintained either on a 6% low fat diet or on a 60% high fat diet and at several points during normal life span. We predict that these dietary differences will have profound effects on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and fecal metabolites, and that the differences will be influenced strongly by genetic factors. We also expect that fecal metabolite data will be a useful predictor of major outcome measures, such as fat mass, longevity, and mitochondrial state. All metabolite data will be entered into the GeneNetwork web service for genetic analysis of the effects of metabolites and diet on GI tract metabolism.

The biology of ovarian cancer (OvCa) is clearly distinct from that of most epithelial tumors, in that hematogenous metastases are rare, and ovarian tumors remain confined to the peritoneal cavity. The omentum, a large pad of fat tissue (20x13x3cm) covering the bowel, is the most common site of OvCa metastasis. It consists primarily of adipocytes, which become the principal microenvironment for the OvCa cells. The underlying hypothesis for this application is that, in the presence of adipocytes, the metabolism of OvCa cells is reprogramed and shifts towards lipid utilization, which provides energy that facilitates tumor growth and metastasis. Preliminary results suggest that primary human omental adipocytes secrete cytokines which promote the metastasis of OvCa cells to the omentum and their subsequent invasion. Once metastasis has occurred, OvCa cells induce lipolysis in omental adipocytes, and use the energy derived from these lipids to proliferate. To study the metabolic changes in the tumor microenvironment we have established a 3D organotypic culture of the human omentum using primary human cells established from patient tissue. Metabolic studies will be performed on adipocytes and OvCa cells individually, on conditioned media and on adipocytes and OvCa cells co-cultured in our 3D model, with the goal of arriving at a comprehensive analysis of primary metabolites and lipids in the tumor microenvironment. In the current investigation, untargeted analysis of primary metabolites and complex lipids were conducted on adipocytes and OvCa cells individually, on conditioned media and on adipocytes and OvCa cells co-cultured in our 3D model. Analysis of oxylipins was conducted on conditioned media. To gain better understanding of the dynamic regulation of metabolic pathways we will also perform metabolic flux analysis using labeled cells (13C-glucose, 13C-glutamine) in the 3D culture model. The primary objective of this study is to gain insight into the dynamic interactions between OvCa cells and human adipocytes with the anticipation of elucidating targets of therapeutic intervention.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000083	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8T884			Quantitative metabolomics by H-NMR and LC-MS/MS confirms altered metabolic pathways in diabetes	Insulin is as a major postprandial hormone with profound effects on carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. In the absence of exogenous insulin, patients with type 1 diabetes exhibit a variety of metabolic abnormalities including hyperglycemia, glycosurea, accelerated ketogenesis, and muscle wasting due to increased proteolysis. We analyzed plasma from type 1 diabetic (T1D) humans during insulin treatment (I+) and acute insulin deprivation (I-) and non-diabetic participants (ND) by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The aim was to determine if this combination of analytical methods could provide information on metabolic pathways known to be altered by insulin deficiency. Multivariate statistics differentiated proton spectra from I- and I+ based on several derived plasma metabolites that were elevated during insulin deprivation (lactate, acetate, allantoin, ketones). Mass spectrometry revealed significant perturbations in levels of plasma amino acids and amino acid metabolites during insulin deprivation. Further analysis of metabolite levels measured by the two analytical techniques indicates several known metabolic pathways that are perturbed in T1D (I-) (protein synthesis and breakdown, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, amino acid oxidation, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and oxidative stress). This work demonstrates the promise of combining multiple analytical methods with advanced statistical methods in quantitative metabolomics research, which we have applied to the clinical situation of acute insulin deprivation in T1D to reflect the numerous metabolic pathways known to be affected by insulin deficiency.

The samples tested were from 2 groups: 1) a group with perinatal exposure to DDT consuming a high fat diet (DDHF), 2) a control group consuming a high fat diet (CHF). Results indicated the DDHF group had comparatively elevated plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, cholesterol, and triglycerides, CYP7A1 gene expression, homeostasis model assessment- insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and fat mass (%), as well as reduced thermogenesis. These data suggest perinatal DDT exposure may cause the co-occurrence of conditions associated with metabolic syndrome, including glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia, impaired thermogenesis, and obesity.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000104	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M80W2M			Impact of insulin deprivation and treatment on sphingolipid distribution in different muscle subcellular compartments of streptozotocin-diabetic C57Bl/6 mice.	Insulin deprivation in type 1 diabetes (T1D) individuals increases lipolysis and plasma free fatty acids (FFA) concentration, which can stimulate synthesis of intramyocellular bioactive lipids such as ceramides (Cer) and long-chain fatty acid-CoAs (LCFa-CoAs). Ceramide was shown to decrease muscle insulin sensitivity, and at mitochondrial levels it stimulates reactive oxygen species production. Here, we show that insulin deprivation in streptozotocin diabetic C57BL/6 mice increases quadriceps muscle Cer content, which was correlated with a concomitant decrease in the body fat and increased plasma FFA, glycosylated hemoglobin level (%Hb A1c), and muscular LCFa-CoA content. The alternations were accompanied by an increase in protein expression in LCFa-CoA and Cer synthesis (FATP1/ACSVL5, CerS1, CerS5), a decrease in the expression of genes implicated in muscle insulin sensitivity (GLUT4, GYS1), and inhibition of insulin signaling cascade by Akt? and GYS3? phosphorylation under acute insulin stimulation. Both the content and composition of sarcoplasmic fraction sphingolipids were most affected by insulin deprivation, whereas mitochondrial fraction sphingolipids remained stable. The observed effects of insulin deprivation were reversed, except for content and composition of LCFa-CoA, CerS protein expression, GYS1 gene expression, and phosphorylation status of Akt and GYS3? when exogenous insulin was provided by subcutaneous insulin implants. Principal component analysis and Pearson's correlation analysis revealed close relationships between the features of the diabetic phenotype, the content of LCFa-CoAs and Cers containing C18-fatty acids in sarcoplasm, but not in mitochondria. Insulin replacement did not completely rescue the phenotype, especially regarding the content of LCFa-CoA, or proteins implicated in Cer synthesis and muscle insulin sensitivity. These persistent changes might contribute to muscle insulin resistance observed in T1D individuals.

Prenatal stress of different nature has been demonstrated to affect both the mother and the offspring. Adverse nutritional conditions during gestation can impair the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and expose the fetus to high levels of glucocorticoids (GC). Evenwhen GC are required for normal brain development; an increased exposure of the fetus to GC as a consequence of prenatal stress can affect fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis (HPG) development, impair neurogenesis, and have a long term impact on the offspring?s mental health. Decreased zinc availability can occur during pregnancy as a consequence of different conditions (nutritional deficiency, infections, diabetes, alcohol consumption, and exposure to certain toxicants). Importantly, several of these gestational conditions have been linked to autism. In fact, alterations in maternal zinc homeostasis upon exposure to select environmental stressors (e.g. the phthalate plasticizer bis-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP)) that have become increasingly common since the industrial revolution may underlie the recent rise in the incidence of autism.Alterations in maternal zinc homeostasis could expose the fetus to high GC concentrations secondary to a high maternal GC production and/or to a decreased capacity of the placenta to metabolize GC to inactive metabolites. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate if alterations in zinc homeostasis during gestation triggered by either a marginal zinc nutrition or exposure to an environmental pollutant (the phthalate plasticizer bis-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP)) can impair maternal and fetal endocrine signaling leading to impaired fetal brain development.

OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of high or low insulin with or without EAAs on MiPS. DESIGN:Thirty participants were randomized to 3 groups of 10 each with each participant studied twice. Study groups comprised (1) low and high insulin, (2) low insulin with and without EAAs, and (3) high insulin with and without EAAs. SETTING:The study was conducted in an in-patient clinical research unit. PARTICIPANTS:Eligible participants were 18 to 45 years old, had a body mass index of <25 kg/m(2), and were free of diseases and medications that might impair mitochondrial function. INTERVENTION:Low (? 6 ?U/mL) and high (? 40 ?U/mL) insulin levels were maintained by iv insulin infusion during a somatostatin clamp while maintaining euglycemia (4.7-5.2 mM) and replacing GH and glucagon. The EAA infusion was 5.4% NephrAmine. l-[ring-(13)C6]Phenylalanine was infused, and muscle needle biopsies were performed. MAIN OUTCOMES:Muscle MiPS, oxidative enzymes, and plasma amino acid metabolites were measured. RESULTS:MiPS and oxidative enzyme activities did not differ between low and high insulin (MiPS: 0.07 ± 0.009 vs 0.07 ± 0.006%/h, P = .86) or between EAAs and saline during low insulin (MiPS: 0.05 ± 0.01 vs 0.07 ± 0.01, P = .5). During high insulin, EAAs in comparison with saline increased MiPS (0.1 ± 0.01 vs 0.06 ± 0.01, P < .05) and cytochrome c oxidase activity (P < .05) but not citrate synthase (P = .27). EAA infusion decreased (P < .05) the glucose infusion rates needed to maintain euglycemia during low (? 40%) and high insulin (? 24%). CONCLUSION:EAAs increased MiPS and oxidative enzyme activity only with high insulin concentrations.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000131	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8WW2P			Association of Metabolic Profile and Microbiome in Chronic Pressure Ulcer Wounds	Chronic, non-healing wounds contribute significantly to the suffering of patients with co-morbidities in the clinical population with mild to severely compromised immune systems. Normal wound healing proceeds through a well-described process. However, in chronic wounds this process seems to become dysregulated at the transition between resolution of inflammation and re-epithelialization. Bioburden in the form of colonizing bacteria is a major contributor to the delayed headlining in chronic wounds such as pressure ulcers. However how the microbiome influences the wound metabolic landscape is unknown. Here, we have used a Systems Biology approach to determine the association between the taxonomic and metabolomic profile of wounds colonized by bacteria. Pressure ulcer biopsies were harvested from primary chronic wounds and bisected into top and bottom sections prior to analysis of microbiome by pyrosequencing and analysis of metabolome using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Bacterial taxonomy revealed that wounds were colonized predominantly by three main phyla, but differed significantly at the genus level. While taxonomic profiles demonstrated significant variability between wounds, metabolic profiles shared significant similarity based on the depth of the wound biopsy. Association between taxonomy and metabolic landscape indicated significant wound-to-wound similarity in metabolite enrichment sets and metabolic pathway impacts, especially with regard to amino acid metabolism. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a statistically robust correlation between bacterial colonization and metabolic landscape within the chronic wound environment.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000143	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8GP4N			Sparing of muscle mass and function by passive loading in an experimental intensive care unit model	The response to mechanical stimuli, i.e. tensegrity, plays an important role in regulating cell physiological and pathophysiological function, and the mechanical silencing observed in intensive care unit (ICU) patients leads to a severe and specific muscle wasting condition. This study aims to unravel the underlying mechanisms and the effects of passive mechanical loading on skeletal muscle mass and function at the gene, protein and cellular levels. A unique experimental rat ICU model has been used allowing long-term (weeks) time-resolved analyses of the effects of standardized unilateral passive mechanical loading on skeletal muscle size and function and underlying mechanisms. Results show that passive mechanical loading alleviated the muscle wasting and the loss of force-generation associated with the ICU intervention, resulting in a doubling of the functional capacity of the loaded versus the unloaded muscles after a 2-week ICU intervention. We demonstrate that the improved maintenance of muscle mass and function is probably a consequence of a reduced oxidative stress revealed by lower levels of carbonylated proteins, and a reduced loss of the molecular motor protein myosin. A complex temporal gene expression pattern, delineated by microarray analysis, was observed with loading-induced changes in transcript levels of sarcomeric proteins, muscle developmental processes, stress response, extracellular matrix/cell adhesion proteins and metabolism. Thus, the results from this study show that passive mechanical loading alleviates the severe negative consequences on muscle size and function associated with the mechanical silencing in ICU patients, strongly supporting early and intense physical therapy in immobilized ICU patients.

The aim of this study was to determine the metabolomic signature in HF and its prognostic value for the response to CRT. Methods: This prospective study consisted of 24 patients undergoing CRT for advanced HF and 10 control patients who underwent catheter ablation for supraventricular arrhythmia but not CRT. Blood samples were collected before and 3 months after CRT. Metabolomic profiling of plasma samples was performed using gas chromatography?mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Results: The plasma metabolomic profile was altered in the HF patients, with a distinct panel of metabolites, including Krebs cycle and lipid, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism. CRT improved the metabolic profile. The succinate/glutamate ratio, an index of Krebs cycle activity, improved from 0.58?0.13 to 2.84?0.60 (P<.05). The glucose/palmitate ratio, an indicator of the balance between glycolytic and fatty acid metabolism, increased from 0.96?0.05 to 1.54?0.09 (P<.01). Compared with the nonresponders to CRT, the responders had a distinct baseline plasma metabolomic profile, including higher isoleucine, phenylalanine, leucine, glucose, and valine levels and lower glutamate levels at baseline (P<.05). Conclusion: CRT improves plasma metabolomic profile of HF patients indicating harmonization of myocardial energy substrate metabolism. CRT responders may have a favorable metabolic profile as a potential biomarker for predicting CRT outcome.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000145	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M87596			Cold Storage of Rat Hepatocyte Spheroids	Cell-based therapies for liver disease rely on a high-quality supply of hepatocytes and a means for storage during transportation from site of isolation to site of usage. Unfortunately, frozen cryopreservation is associated with unacceptable loss of hepatocyte viability after thawing. The purpose of this study was to optimize conditions for cold storage of rat hepatocyte spheroids without freezing. Rat hepatocytes were isolated by a two-step perfusion method; hepatocyte spheroids were formed during 48 h of rocked culture in serum-free medium (SFM). Spheroids were then maintained in rocked culture at 37 °C (control condition) or cold stored at 4 °C for 24 or 48 h in six different cold storage solutions: SFM alone; SFM + 1 mM deferoxamine (Def); SFM + 1 ?M cyclosporin A (CsA); SFM + 1 mM Def + 1 ?M CsA, University of Wisconsin (UW) solution alone, UW + 1 mM Def. Performance metrics after cold storage included viability, gene expression, albumin production, and functional activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes and urea cycle proteins. We observed that cold-induced injury was reduced significantly by the addition of the iron chelator (Def) to both SFM and UW solution. Performance metrics (ammonia detoxification, albumin production) of rat hepatocyte spheroids stored in SFM + Def for 24 h were significantly increased from SFM alone and approached those in control conditions, while performance metrics after cold storage in SFM alone or cold storage for 48 h were both significantly reduced. A serum-free medium supplemented with Def allowed hepatocyte spheroids to tolerate 24 h of cold storage with less than 10% loss in viability and functionality. Further research is warranted to optimize a solution for extended cold storage of hepatocyte spheroids.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000146	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M83G6X			Effect of Insulin Sensitizer Therapy on Amino Acids and Their Metabolites	Aims Prior studies have reported that elevated concentrations of several plasma amino acids (AA), particularly branched chain (BCAA) and aromatic AA predict the onset of type 2 diabetes. We sought to test the hypothesis that circulating BCAA, aromatic AA and related AA metabolites decline in response to the use of insulin sensitizing agents in overweight/obese adults with impaired fasting glucose or untreated diabetes. Methods We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo, controlled study conducted in twenty five overweight/obese (BMI ~ 30 kg/m2) adults with impaired fasting glucose or untreated diabetes. Participants were randomized to three months of pioglitazone (45 mg per day) plus metformin (1000 mg twice per day, N = 12 participants) or placebo (N = 13). We measured insulin sensitivity by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and fasting concentrations of AA and AA metabolites using ultra-pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry before and after the three-month intervention. Results Insulin sensitizer therapy that significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity reduced 9 out of 33 AA and AA metabolites measured compared to placebo treatment. Moreover, insulin sensitizer therapy significantly reduced three functionally clustered AA and metabolite pairs: i) phenylalanine/tyrosine, ii) citrulline/arginine, and iii) lysine/?-aminoadipic acid. Conclusions Reductions in plasma concentrations of several AA and AA metabolites in response to three months of insulin sensitizer therapy support the concept that reduced insulin sensitivity alters AA and AA metabolites.

Understanding the molecular basis of the therapy refractoriness of GBM is one of the most important areas of glioma research.IDH1 is a critical enzyme of the citric acid cycle (CAC) and is a master regulator of metabolism. Building on his preliminary studies, Dr. Stegh will molecularly characterize the precise mechanism, by which IDH1 protects glioma cells from therapy-induced cell death using glioma cell and mouse models. To target IDH1 signaling in GBM, he will leverage these model systems and mechanistical knowledge to develop and preclinically characterize RNA interference RNAi-based nanomaterials. He will generate RNAi-functionalized spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) that neutralize IDH1 expression in established gliomas. Due to the negative charge of the RNA backbone, however, siRNA oligonucleotides have many downsides, such as they trigger auto-immune responses, and cannot cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). In contrast, SNAs are able to transverse cellular membranes, do not require the use of toxic auxiliary reagents, and accumulate in cells and intracranial tumors very effectively. They also exhibit extraordinary stability in physiological environments, cross the BBB, are highly resistant to nuclease degradation, and thus, can move through biological fluids and avoid being destroyed as “foreign materials.” Dr. Stegh proposes to preclinically evaluate these IDH1-targeting nanoconjugates to provide a fundamentally novel treatment option of patients diagnosed with GBM, and will aid in successfully implementing RNAi-based therapies into neuro-oncological practice.

The prognosis of ICC is generally worse than that of HCC because there is lack of early diagnostic marker for ICC and the carcinogenic mechanism of ICC is not fully understood. So our aim was to perform metabolome and transcriptome analysis to reveal the carcinogenetic mechanism and to detect an early diagnostic marker for ICC Ten ICC and 6 HCC which were resected surgically, were enrolled. miRNA and mRNA expression analysis were performed by microarray on ICC and HCC and their corresponding non-tumor tissues (ICC_NT and HCC_NT). Compound analysis was performed using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). Principle component analysis (PCA) revealed that our four sample groups (ICC, ICC_NT, HCC, and HCC_NT) have 14 compounds, 62 mRNAs and 17 miRNAs with distinct expressive patterns. There were two distinct patterns among the 4 groups; one is tumor and non-tumor, the other is ICC and non-ICC. To clarify the biological significance of individual genes and compounds, we performed pathway analysis. ICC formation was related to RNA synthesis, amino acid synthesis, and glucose-lipid synthesis pathway. ICC was classified by distinct pattern of compounds with high accuracy (84.38%). PCA revealed that several pathways were associated with the development of ICC and distinguished ICC from other diseases. These findings are a promising step towards establishing novel biomarkers that can be clinically applicable.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000188	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8ZK5B			Nicotine alters brain oxidative metabolism	Nicotine addiction through the use of cigarettes is the most common form of chemical dependency in the United States. Despite global warnings and awareness of the detrimental effects of smoking on health, smoking-derived nicotine dependence makes it very difficult to relinquish the habit. Unfortunately, nicotine exposure makes females more susceptible to ischemic neurodegeneration. Moreover, this susceptibility is enhanced when combined with oral contraceptives. Usually, women initiate nicotine usage during their adolescence, the period of life when one also is likely to get sexually active and also likely to use oral contraceptives. The underlying mechanisms responsible for the exacerbated neurodegeneration due to the long exposure of nicotine and oral contraceptives are not known. Our published studies showed that nicotine toxicity is exacerbated by oral contraceptives via altered mitochondrial function and increased reactive oxygen species production in the hippocampus of female rats. This mitochondrial dysfunction involved a defect on the enzymatic activity of the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain (complex IV) as a consequence of an impaired biogenesis. However, how this mitochondrial impairment impacts the overall brain metabolism remains to be investigated. To understand the overall effect of nicotine on the brain metabolism and the mechanisms responsible for the enhanced toxicity of nicotine when combined with oral contraceptives, we propose two specific aims. We will investigate the metabolomic profile of brains (hippocampus) of female rats treated with nicotine alone or in combination with oral contraceptives. We will also determine the effect on the activity and steady-state levels of key regulatory metabolic enzymes. We will use an established rat animal model mimicking conditions of nicotine exposure produced by cigarette smoking and simulating conditions of oral contraceptives usage taking in consideration hormonal cycles in women. Discerning the exact effects of nicotine and its combination with oral contraceptives on overall brain metabolisms at different ages will open a new window for future therapeutic intervention. This intervention will reduce their susceptibility to neurodegenerative conditions in women trying to give up nicotine addiction.

In addition, as a convenient opportunity, the species difference of urinary metabolites between human and SD rats were also observed. Human urine samples were collected before breakfast from 14 male and 13 female Chinese post-graduate students, age from 23 to 29, on the morning of sample collection day. Male (n=8) and female (n=8) SD rats weighing between 220 and 250g were used. On the morning of sample collection day, each rat was deprived of food and put in metabolic cage for 24h urine collection. Then a blood sample (3-5ml) was collected from the aorta of the rat under anesthesia and centrifuged to obtain serum. All urine and serum samples were frozen at -80°C prior to analysis. The study of sex differences is important for finding the best course of treatment of disease as well as for developing novel targets of therapy. A more complete understanding of the metabolic differences across sex-based subgroups is helpful to improve the mechanistic understanding of sex differences.

The PIs recently demonstrated that female mosses produce large numbers of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that specifically attract microarthropods, and that the presence of these insects increases fertilization rates (ie, a previously unknown fertilization syndrome). Male mosses produce many fewer VOCs, suggesting that VOC production may be costly. Collectively, these results suggest that alleles controlling VOC production may experience ongoing sexual antagonism. Here the PIs propose to generate pilot data to rigorously establish a link between dimorphisms in metabolite profile and its underlying genetic bases in the moss Ceratodon purpureus and related species.

Yield losses to O3 are projected to as much as double by mid-century, and there is thought to be little potential for adaptation to rising O3 concentrations ([O3]) through altered crop management practices. Therefore, the only solution to current and future O3-induced yield loss is development of O3 tolerant maize through breeding and/or biotechnology. In this project, we will investigate the metabolite profiles that underpin O3 sensitivity in maize.

In order to assess whether or not the novel analogues were incorporated into complex lipids, cells were treated with compond and then lipids extracted. Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FTICR-MS) was employed for the analysis of complex lipids. Data processing involved mass detection, chromatographic peak detection and deconvolution, isotopic peaks grouping, normalization and peak alignment. Significantly altered metabolites were defined by a fold change (FC) >2 and p<0.05. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) of signature metabolites altered in compounds treated cells compared to control were performed in the Metaboanalyst web portal (www.metaboanalyst.ca).

We will culture in vitro Candida cells to the mid-logarithmic growth in liquid media (RPMI-1640) at 37°C and then inoculate biological replicates (1ml) onto 22mm nitrocellulose filters under vocuum filtration in sterile conditions. Subsequently, isolates will be cultivated to midlogarithmic phase of growth on the same agar (RPMI-1640) to which the antifungal agent has been added at a range of concentrations to achieve doses equivalent to 0 MIC (no drug), 0.0625 MIC, 0.125 MIC, 0.25 MIC, 0.5 MIC and 1.0 MIC at 37°C. At mid-logarithmic phase of growth (12h) replicates will be metabolically quenched by immersion into a solvent mixture of 40% acetonitrile: 40% methanol: 20% water precooled at -40°C. The resulting quenched isolate/solvent mixtrue will be mechanically lysed by bead-beating with 0.1mm Zirconia beads in a tissue homogenizer and then centrifuged to seperate out cell wall components.

The collaborative team of researchers assembled for this work have identified horses severely affected with Equine Metabolic syndrome, often characterized by obesity and hyperinsulinemia. These animals are all from the Arabian breed, to control for some genetic background. Horses are age, sex and farm of residence matched with a control animal whenever possible. Carefully controlled collection protocols were utilized to ensure minimal variability in sample age and quality. Blood plasma is submitted for both global LC-MS analysis through the SECIM core facilities. This discovery-based approach will begin to generate new targets for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for the treatment and prevention of obesity, type-2 diabetes as well as related secondary conditions in both humans and horses. Finally, as the first dataset of its kind in the horse, we may also be able to highlight promising new biomarkers for veterinary diagnostic use.

As such, there exists an on-going critical need to study S. aureus genes that promote growth and resistance to host immune responses, so that their encoded products can eventually be evaluated for potential as novel antimicrobial targets. In this respect, S. aureus nitric-oxide (NO) synthase (saNOS) and NO-reductase (saNOR) have been recently shown to dramatically affect the physiology of this pathogen. Specifically, nos mutants have displayed decreased virulence in both subcutaneous abscess and sepsis models of infection, and our own research has suggested that NO produced via saNOS has a negative effect on endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation under growth conditions promoting aerobic respiration and may regulate metabolism in an as-yet unknown fashion. Our research has also demonstrated a role for saNOR in modulating cellular NO levels when exposed to exogenous NO donor and may contribute to cellular metabolism under conditions of nitrosative stress. Therefore, overall hypothesis of this proposal is that modulation of exogenous and endogenous NO levels (by saNOR and saNOS, respectively) represent novel metabolic adaptations that contribute to S. aureus survival during infection. To this end, a global untargeted metabolomics approach will be employed to complete two research aims: Aim 1: Compare the effect of saNOR on S. aureus metabolism when grown in the presence and absence of exogenous NO. Aim 2: Identify the effects of endogenous NO produced by saNOS on S. aureus metabolism when grown under conditions promoting aerobic respiration. These proposed studies will help catalogue the exact metabolic changes that occur as a function of saNOS and saNOR, which will help unravel the upstream regulatory circuits and downstream cellular targets of both of these enzymes.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000200	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8JC79			Metabolic heterogeneity in Glioblastoma	Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and complex primary brain tumor in adults and has a dismal prognosis, which is attributed largely to the extreme heterogeneity in the cells that make up the cancer and the continual molecular, genetic and metabolic adaptations driving tumor initiation, propagation and resistance to conventional treatments. The most important clinical target to prevent these mechanisms of initiation, propagation and disease recurrence may be a subset of tumor cells, cancer stem cells. Hence, identifying targetable key features of this population is of great interest for the elaboration of strategies to prevent disease initiation and propagation as well as recurrence post treatments. In response to i) the limited success to treat GB that remains universally fatal, ii) the evidences pointing to tumor heterogeneity as the greatest obstacle to achieve therapeutic efficacy and iii) the increasing understanding and importance of bioenergetics in tumor biology and the critical need to integrate metabolism into treatment paradigms, we propose a new model residing in the unique and unprecedented hypothesis of an association between GB management, a distinct slow-cycling cancer stem cell subpopulation and metabolic targeting.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000206	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8RW2F			The role of microbial metabolites in experimental liver disease	Liver fibrosis is the result of chronic liver damage from various etiologies including toxins, alcohol abuse, obesity, or viral hepatitis. Chronic liver disease may progress to cirrhosis, an end stage organ disease, and liver cancer. Patients with chronic liver disease show intestinal bacterial overgrowth and dysbiosis. They also demonstrate increased intestinal permeability, and disease severity correlates with systemic levels of bacterial products. Although experimental liver fibrosis is dependent on gut derived bacterial products, the exact contribution of the commensal microflora to chronic liver disease in unknown. Since the interaction of bacterial products with the innate immune system can also confer protection to the host, we subjected germfree mice to experimental models of liver fibrosis. Results from our laboratory demonstrate that germfree mice show exacerbated liver fibrosis as compared to conventional mice. Our previous studies also have indicated that a bacterial metabolite of tryptophan, Indole-3-propionic Acid (IPA), is absent in germ free mice. In this study we are investigating the role of IPA in acute and chronic models of liver fibrosis.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000208	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8HC70			Signal Intensities Derived from Different NMR Probes and Parameters Contribute to Variations in Quantification of Metabolites	We discovered that serious issues could arise that may complicate interpretation of metabolomic data when identical samples are analyzed at more than one NMR facility, or using slightly different NMR parameters on the same instrument. This is important because cross-center validation metabolomics studies are essential for the reliable application ofmetabolomics to clinical biomarker discovery. To test the reproducibility of quantified metabolite data at multiple sites, technical replicates of urine samples were assayed by 1D-1H-NMR at the University of Alberta and the University of Michigan. Urine samples were obtained from healthy controls under a standard operating procedure for collection and processing. Subsequent analysis using standard statistical techniques revealed that quantitative data across sites can be achieved, but also that previously unrecognized NMR parameter differences can dramatically and widely perturb results. We present here a confirmed validation of NMR analysis at two sites, and report the range and magnitude that common NMR parameters involved in solvent suppression can have on quantitated metabolomics data. Specifically, saturation power levels greatly influenced peak height intensities in a frequency-dependent manner for a number of metabolites, which markedly impacted the quantification of metabolites. We also investigated other NMR parameters to determine their effects on further quantitative accuracy and precision. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of and need for consistent use of NMR parameter settings within and across centers in order to generate reliable, reproducible quantified NMR metabolomics data.

Mice were divided into three groups termed LFD (low fat diet), HFD (high fat diet), and SW (switch diet from HFD to LFD)(n = 6 per group). All mice were fed normal chow until 12 weeks of age. The LFD group were fed a low fat diet (10% fat) ad libitum for 18 weeks. The HFD diet group were fed high fat diet (60% fat) ad libitum for 18 weeks. The SW group were fed high fat diet for 9 weeks, then low fat diet for 9 weeks after which their body weights returned to similar levels as the LFD group. Each group was analyzed for metabolite and gene expression changes.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000210	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M87W2S			Effects of synthetic large-scale genome reduction on metabolism and metabolic preferences in a nutritionally complex environment	The soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti forms nodules on the roots of leguminous plants, where N2 is reduced to ammonia. Its genome includes a 3.65 Mb chromosome, a 1.35 Mb pSymA megaplasmid, and a 1.68 Mb pSymB chromid. pSymA and pSymB constitute ~45% of the genome and here a non-targeted approach was used to identify the metabolic consequences of the removal of these replicons. Polar and non-polar metabolites from wild-type, ?pSymA, ?pSymB, and ?pSymAB cells and supernatants across a growth curve were analyzed by LC-HILIC-TOF-MS. 2008 metabolite features were identified in the extracellular metabolome of cells grown in LBmc containing yeast extract and casein hydrolysate. 1474 features were found from the intracellular metabolites of cells grown in minimal M9-sucrose medium. Analysis revealed both time and genotype influenced the metabolome, with the removal of pSymB having a much greater effect than the loss of pSymA. Strains lacking pSymB showed an increase in sugar, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolites in the intracellular metabolome, and the loss of pSymB clearly impaired the cell’s ability to catabolize exogenous amino acids. We conclude that despite the ability of wild-type, ?pSymA, ?pSymB, and ?pSymAB strains to grow in both M9-sucrose and LBmc media, the removal of pSymA, and particularly pSymB, had clear and dramatic effects on the S. meliloti metabolome. The larger effect associated with the pSymB chromid is consistent with the large number of metabolic genes on this replicon and the greater genetic and metabolic integration of this replicon with the S. meliloti chromosome.

In this study, the ability of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) to induce myofibroblast differentiation was analyzed in isolated human lung fibroblasts, and its in vivo significance was evaluated in rodent bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The results showed that SHH could induce myofibroblast differentiation in human lung fibroblasts in a Smo- and Gli1-dependent manner. Gel shift analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that a Gli1 binding consensus in the ?-SMA gene promoter was important for mediating SHH-induced myofibroblast differentiation. Analysis of Hedgehog reemergence in vivo revealed that of all three Hedgehog isoforms, only SHH was significantly induced in bleomycin-injured lung along with Gli1. The induction of SHH was only noted in epithelial cells, and its expression was undetectable in lung fibroblasts or macrophages. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-? induced SHH significantly in cultured alveolar epithelial cells, whereas SHH induced TGF-? in lung fibroblasts. Pulmonary fibrosis and ?-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) expression were significantly reduced in mice that were Smo deficient only in type I collagen?expressing cells. Thus, the reemergence of SHH in epithelial cells could result in induction of myofibroblast differentiation in a Smo-dependent manner and subsequent Gli1 activation of the ?-SMA promoter.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000226	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8FG61			Colorectal Cancer Detection Using Targeted Serum Metabolic Profiling	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers in the world. Despite an expanding knowledge of its molecular pathogenesis during the past two decades, robust biomarkers to enable screening, surveillance, and therapy monitoring of CRC are still lacking. In this study, we present a targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling approach for identifying biomarker candidates that could enable highly sensitive and specific CRC detection using human serum samples. In this targeted approach, 158 metabolites from 25 metabolic pathways of potential significance were monitored in 234 serum samples from three groups of patients (66 CRC patients, 76 polyp patients, and 92 healthy controls). Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were established, which proved to be powerful for distinguishing CRC patients from both healthy controls and polyp patients. Receiver operating characteristic curves generated based on these PLS-DA models showed high sensitivities (0.96 and 0.89, respectively, for differentiating CRC patients from healthy controls or polyp patients); good specificities (0.80 and 0.88), and excellent areas under the curve (0.93 and 0.95) were also obtained. Monte Carlo cross validation (MCCV) was also applied, demonstrating the robust diagnostic power of this metabolic profiling approach.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000227	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M89P43			NMR-based Metabolomics for CRC Diagnosis	Despite the fact that colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers in the world, the development of improved and robust biomarkers to enable screening, surveillance, and therapy monitoring of CRC continues to be evasive. In particular, patients with colon polyps are at higher risk of developing colon cancer; however, noninvasive methods to identify these patients suffer from poor performance. In consideration of the challenges involved in identifying metabolite biomarkers in individuals with high risk for colon cancer, we have investigated NMR-based metabolite profiling in combination with numerous demographic parameters to investigate the ability of serum metabolites to differentiate polyp/CRC patients from healthy subjects. We also investigated the effect of disease risk on different groups of biologically related metabolites. Our study may explain some of the challenges and promise a novel avenue for future metabolite profiling methodologies.

Because most diapausing insects do not feed, they must live off their body reserves for several months and the proper use of metabolic reserves is critical for surviving diapause and performing after diapause termination. Across multiple insects, metabolic depression during diapause has been associated with a switch from aerobic metabolism to facultative anaerobic metabolism, despite insects not suffering environmental oxygen limitation. While metabolic rates are depressed during diapause overall to save energy, some insects show regular cyclical bouts of higher metabolic activity during diapause. The functional importance of these metabolic cycles and the mechanisms underlying these cycles are still unknown, but they may be critical for properly maintaining the balance between energy states and purge the accumulation of anaerobic metabolic byproducts. In the present study, we will test the hypothesis that periodic cycles of increased metabolism during insect diapause are associated with both regenerating organismal energetic states, particularly ATP that may decline during metabolic depression, and for purging metabolites associated with anaerobic metabolism. We will use a combination of non-targeted uHPLC-MS/MS metabolomics and targeted NMR-spectroscopy to identify and quantify metabolites that are altered during the cycles in diapausing pupae of the flesh fly, Sarcophaga crassipalpis. This work will allow us to propose specific biochemical and cellular hypotheses for the regulation of cyclic releases from metabolic depression in diapausing insects. Our work may not only reveal the physiological mechanisms regulating metabolic cycles during diapause in flesh fly, but also provide insight to understand the regulation of similar metabolic cycles in mammalian hibernators (i.e., periodic arousal), and also provide insights into how these cycles could be exploited to disrupt the diapause of insect pests.

The objective of this study is to investigate whether the severity of atherosclerosis is associated not only with lipoprotein concentrations, weight, blood pressure, biomarkers of inflammation and IR in an animal model but also changes in parameters that measure protein glycation. The experimental approach was to study normocholestrolemic pigs fed a high fat diet that also contained increased NaCl. The choice of pigs was driven by the fact that, like humans, they develop coronary artery and aortic atherosclerosis and insulin resistance. In addition, pigs have been used in many studies to define the mechanisms that mediate increased atherosclerosis in diabetes.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000246	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8088P			Metabolomics Approach to Identify Molecules and Pathways Involved in the Development of Atherosclerotic Coronary Artery Disease	Genetics play major roles in the development of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). Despite tremendous efforts worldwide invested to decipher the genetic components controlling the development of CAD, the genetic architecture of CAD remains largely unclear. As part of an on-going effort to identify molecules and pathways involved in the development of atherosclerotic CAD, we propose to use rigorous angiographic criteria to define CAD phenotype for genomics and metabolomics study. We identified two extreme groups, namely “young CAD” group, who are very young individuals (age <= 40 years) proven to have severe CAD required revascularization, and “CAD-free elderly”, who are at very advanced age (Age >= 80 years) but have no angiographically apparent CAD. Phenotypically, these two groups are in sharp contrary. Conventional risk factors account for small portion of different phenotypes. We hypothesize that there are genetically programmed pathways and molecules accelerating atherosclerotic pathogenesis, in the “young CAD” patients and preventing the development of CAD in the “CAD-free elderly” patients. We sought to combine genomics and metabolomics approaches to profile and identify these pathways and molecules. Both plasma and urine samples from patients in these two groups, and their age matched control groups, will undergo unbiased metabolomics profiling with high throughput quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) technology in RTI metabolomics core facility. Comprehensive statistic and multi-variant analytic approaches will be used to identify pathways and molecules significance to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. These data will be integrated with genomics data from next generation sequencing of genetic materials from the same groups of patients to further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis and CAD.

The physiological and molecular mechanisms that are critical in HS morbidity and mortality, both during and after HS onset, remain yet to be elucidated. Current clinical biomarkers lack specificity and sensitivity to accurately diagnose HS severity, and there is a critical need for effective pharmacologic interventions and treatments that address this life-threatening disease. The systemic inflammatory response (SIR) is one target for such pharmacological interventions, as it is thought to mediate much of HS etiology. For this reason, anti-inflammatories have been directed at the SIR in an effort to treat and prevent HS. Due to their anti-inflammatory actions, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have been suggested as a treatment candidate for HS. Currently, NSAIDs are one of the most widely used medications across the world, with hundreds of millions of doses prescribed yearly. Of special concern, NSAID use is prolific throughout the U.S. Armed Forces. We recently examin4ed the effect of using NSAIDs to treat HS, and found that NSAIDs actually increase HS mortality and exacerbate the systemic organ damage (e.g., gut, kidneys) found in HS recovery in mice. Our finding suggest the use of NSAIDs by civilians and military populations may increase the risk of HS morbidity and mortality. The objective of this proposal is to exploit broad spectrum metabolomic analysis to identify new biomarkers of multi-organ damage that will improve HS diagnosis and treatment.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000254	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8Z88C			Metabolomics and Childhood Obesity: A Pilot and Feasibility Study With Multiple Phenotypic Anchors	“Metabolomics” is a powerful new analytical approach for measuring and evaluating all small and intermediate sized metabolites in a variety of tissues or samples in conditions of health and disease. The purpose of this research is to determine if “metabolomics” can be used to address several important unanswered questions about obesity in children. First we will use metabolomics to identify patterns of metabolites in blood that are unique to obese children. We will then determine if these patterns are predictive of excessive weight gain and/or poor weight loss response in non-obese and obese children enrolled in an exercise program. This knowledge will help us understand why some children are destined to become obese and/or are poorly responsive to treatment. This will help identify children who might need more aggressive, expensive or personally tailored obesity treatments. Second we plan to use metabolomics to identify metabolic signals specifically associated with the early initiation of atherosclerosis (and hence increased risk for cardiovascular disease [CVD]) in obese children. We expect that this knowledge will ultimately lead to better early risk assessment and opportunities for risk reduction in both obese and non-obese children than allowed by current clinical practices. Finally the knowledge gained from this research could be applied in the future to prospectively assess – and therefore proactively manage ~ a broad range of risk factors in large numbers of young children in a rational and cost effective manner.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000255	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8TG7T			Comparison of Metabolites Variation and Antiobesity Effects of a Mixture of Cudrania tricuspidata, Lonicera caerulea, and the Soybean According to Fermentation in vitro and in vivo	We used ultra-performance-liquid-chromatography with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry to study the changes in metabolites in the mixture of Cudrania tricuspidata, Lonicera caerulea, and soybean (CLM) during fermentation. Additionally, the antiobesity effects of CLM and fermented-CLM (FCLM) were studied based on the analysis of plasma from high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. The levels of cyanidin and the glycosides of luteolin, quercetin, and cyanidin derived from L. caerulea were decreased, whereas the levels of luteolin and quercetin were increased during fermentation. Isoflavone glycosides and soyasaponins originating from the soybean were decreased, whereas their aglycones such as daidzein, glycitein, and genistein were increased. As for prenylated flavonoids from C. tricuspidata, these metabolites were decreased at the early stage of fermentation, and were increased at end of the fermentation. In terms of the functional food product, various metabolites derived from diverse natural products in CLM had complementary effects and demonstrated higher antioxidant and pancreatic lipase inhibition activities by fermentation; these activities were closely related to flavonoid aglycones including genistein, daidzein, glycitein, luteolin, and quercetin. In vivo experiment, several clinical parameters affected by HFD were remarkably improved by the administration of either CLM or FCLM, but there was a difference in the antiobesity effects. The levels of lysoPCs with C20:4, C16:0, and C22:6 were significantly attenuated by CLM administration, while the attenuated levels of lysoPCs with C20:4 and C18:2 were significantly restored by FCLM administration. These metabolites may explain the above-mentioned differences in antiobesity effects. Although only the changes in plasma lysophospholipids could not fully explain antiobesity effects between non-fermented and fermented plant mixtures from our results, we suggest that metabolomics approach could provide a way to reveal the metabolite alterations in the complex fermentation process and understand the differences or changes in bioactivity according to fermentation.

Lactating dairy cows had estrous cycles synchronized and were subjected to induced ovulation and timed artificial insemination (AI). The day of AI was considered study d 0. On d 15, uteri were flushed by transcervical catheterization and infusion of 20 mL of phosphate buffered solution with 0.1% of polyvinyl acetate. Recovered conceptuses were classified based on morphology/length as ovoid (OV; 1-4 mm), tubular (TUB; 5-19 mm) and filamentous (FIL; 20-85 mm). The first 20 mL infused in the uterus were recovered, placed in conical tubes and centrifuged at 2,000 × g at 4?C. The supernatant was collect, aliquoted and stored at -80?C for later analyses of fluid composition, including measurement of IFN-t concentration. Cows with no conceptus recovered and no detection of IFN-t in uterine flushing were considered as nonpregnant (NPREG). The experimental design was then considered a prospective cohort study with 4 independent groups (NPREG, OV, TUB, and FIL).

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000270	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8W894			Gut microbiome-derived metabolites modulate intestinal epithelial cell damage and mitigate graft-versus-host disease	Taxonomic alterations in the intestinal microbiota are being progressively associated with many diseases, including graft-versus host disease (GVHD). However, the impact of these alterations on microbial metabolites and by-products and their subsequent impact on disease processes, such as GVHD, are not known. Here we utilized a targetedn unbiased and blinded approach in a blinded fashion to identify novel alterations in the levels of microbial metabolites, specifically levels including the short chain fatty acid (SCFA) and endogenous histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), butyrate, after allo-BMT. Surprisingly, alterations were observed only in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) but not in the luminal contents. The reduced butyrate in IECs (CD326+) after allo-BMT resulted in decreased histone acetylation, which was restored upon local administration of exogenous butyrate. This resulted in improved IEC junctional integrity, increased anti-apoptotic proteins, decreased GVHD, and improved survival. Furthermore, alteration of endogenous microflora with 17 rationally selected strains of high butyrate producing Clostridia, also decreased GVHD and increased survival following allo-BMT in experiments performed at two different institutions. These data demonstrate an heretofore unrecognized role of microbial metabolites and suggests that local and specific alteration of microbial metabolites has direct salutary effects on GVHD target tissues and mitigates its severity.

The ability to efficiently and rapidly adjust to the changing environment is essential for its pathogenic lifestyle. Oxidative stress is one of the most important environmental variables affecting the pathogenic potential of S. mutans, as high oxygen concentrations disfavor growth of S. mutans and other oral bacteria. In order to fulfill its role as a major constituent of cariogenic oral biofilms and sustain virulence, S. mutans must overcome oxidative stress. Oxidation sensing and response is a complex yet highly-regulated process, particularly because it is cross-regulated with other metabolic pathways, stress responses and virulence physiology. In addition, we previously showed that exposure of S. mutans to oxygen strongly inhibits biofilm formation and alters cell surface biogenesis, possibly through AtlA, a major autolysin of the organism. More recently, we have also shown that S. mutans Cid/Lrg system, potentially mediating cell lysis/death in a programmed fashion, uniquely leads a global readjustment in central metabolism and virulence processes, particularly in coping with oxidative stress. To this end, a targeted metabolomics approach will be employed to understand how these autolytic systems influence the metabolism of S. mutans, ultimately leading to a more complete appreciation of how S. mutans survives and persists in hostile host microenvironment.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000281	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8KW38			Metabolic profiling reveals biochemical pathways and potential biomarkers associated with the pathogenesis of Krabbe disease	Krabbe disease (KD) is caused by mutations in the galactosylceramidase (GALC) gene, which encodes a lysosomal enzyme that degrades galactolipids, including galactosylceramide and galactosylsphingosine (psychosine). GALC deficiency results in progressive intracellular accumulation of psychosine, which is believed to be the main cause for the demyelinating neurodegeneration in KD pathology. Umbilical cord blood transplantation slows disease progression if performed presymptomatically, but carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Accurate presymptomatic diagnosis is therefore critical to facilitate the efficacy of existing transplant approaches and avoid unnecessary treatment of children who will not develop KD. Unfortunately current diagnostic criteria, including GALC activity, genetic analysis, and psychosine measurement, are insufficient for secure presymptomatic diagnosis. Herein, we performed a global metabolomic analysis to identify pathogenetic metabolic pathways and novel biomarkers implicated in the authentic mouse model of KD, twitcher. At a time point before onset of signs of disease, twitcher hindbrains had metabolic profiles similar to wild type, with the exception of a decrease in metabolites related to glucose energy metabolism. Instead, many metabolic pathways were altered after early signs of disease in the twitcher, including decreased phospholipid turnover, restricted mitochondrial metabolism of branched-chain amino acids, increased inflammation, neurotransmitter metabolism and osmolytes. Hypoxanthine, a purine derivative, is increased before signs of disease appear, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis of KD. Additionally, given the early changes in glucose metabolism in the pathogenesis of KD, diagnostic modalities that report metabolic function, such as positron emission tomography, may be useful in KD.

With limited availability of nematicides and lack of tolerant cultivars, turf managers need new genetically resistant cultivars. Use of resistant or tolerant grasses is the most efficient, environmentally friendly and, in the long run, least costly component of IPM. Current screening of new genotypes for nematode resistance is labor- and time-intensive, with three months required soley for nematode development on test plants. We intend to develop metabolomic markers or a signature pattern associated with nematode resistance or tolerance. Screening plants for these markers or a signature pattern of would greatly speed up the screening process and development of resistant cultivars.

While it is clear that there are genetic components to the risk of developing mental health disorders, a role for environmental factors in inducing these problems has been suggested. Many of these factors that affect the brain likely involve exposures that occur early in life. Two such factors are the higher rates of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 seropositivity and prevalence of obesity among these children. HSV-1 infection has been associated with impaired cognition during childhood and mental health problems in adulthood. Additionally, obese adults are shown to have higher HSV-1 titers. Similarly, other studies have correlated a diet high in saturated fat and obesity with increased risk of mood disorders and anxiety. A mouse model of obese HSV-1 latent infection was developed. Broad spectrum metabolomics analysis was performed to better understand the metabolomic profile of hippocampus and to compare this metabolomics profile with that of the hypothalamus, microglia, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Brain tissue samples for metabolomics experiments were generated in the following manner: 3-week old mice were placed on a 10% low fat (LF) diet and acclimated for one week prior to intranasal HSV-1 infection or mock infection with PBS. Fourteen days post-infection mice were randomized to either a 45% high fat diet (HF) or remained on the LF diet. Eight weeks post-diet transition, mice were euthanized and brain tissue samples were collected and processed for metabolomics.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000287	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8Z310			Characterization and Plasticity of the Metabolome in Peripheral Cells in Bipolar I Disorder	Bipolar disorder is a serious condition characterized by severe and debilitating elevations and depressions in mood and energy (1). Bipolar I disorder (BPI) is a particularly severe phenotype which is generally defined as having periods of abnormal moods ranging from “highs,” (mania or hypomania), to “lows” (depression), alternating with periods of relatively normal moods. Key problems in treating bipolar disorder relate to the fact that the pathophysiology of the disorder remains elusive; as a result, there are currently no laboratory tests for diagnosis, to aid treatment decisions, or to predict treatment responses. Recent advances in the study of bipolar disorder increasingly implicate mitochondrial and bioenergetic dysfunction as a common feature of the pathophysiology of the disorder (2). Shifts in metabolism from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation toward glycolysis have been observed in the brains of bipolar patients experiencing depressive mood states (3). Increased oxidative stress has also been shown in postmortem brain from bipolar patients (4), and in cultured peripheral fibroblasts from patients with major depression (5). However, little is known about the inherent metabolic state of peripheral cells during bipolar disorder, which may reflect the overall metabolic profile of the individual and may also impact the supply of nutrients to the brain. We propose to characterize the baseline metabolomic profiles of peripheral cells in cultured fibroblasts from patients with BPI and matched non-affected controls. Patients with Bipolar I Disorder (BPI) and matched non-affected controls were recruited. Males and females from all races and ethnicities between the ages of 19-65 participated in the research. Skin biopsies were obtained and fibroblasts were isolated from each of these biopsies. A total of 1 x ?10?^7 fibroblasts cells were used for metabolomics. Cell pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped on dry ice to the NIH Eastern Regional Comprehensive Metabolomic Resource Core at RTI International in North Carolina. Metabolomics will be determined using a broad spectrum metabolomics protocol by RTI.

Activity observed at 5 days post fertilization is will be used to determine if there is a correlation between biological pathways implicated by these metabolic profiles and cardiovascular, metabolic (obesity), and neurological phenotypes.

The results from this study will demonstrate the power of using zebrafish as a model for mechanism discovery in exposure using metabolomics to advance understanding of early life exposure to Cd and Pb and serve as preliminary data for opportunities.

However, no specific bacteria have been unequivocally linked to either initiation or progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). A Microbiome analysis was conducted to analyze the microbiota composition and functional potential in African Americans with colorectal lesions with the goal of detecting markers of diagnostic value. DNA from 10 CRC tumors and their matched normal tissues as well as stool samples from 10 colon adenomas and 10 healthy subjects were analyzed for their bacterial composition and genomic content. 16S rDNA amplicons were analyzed by HITChip 16S microarray and by sequencing in stool samples and colon tissues, respectively. The functional potential was determined by sequence-based metagenomics using Illumina at a depth of 15 million reads per tissue sample to compensate for the host’s DNA presence. For the stools, the metagenomic sequencing was performed at 3 million reads per sample. Metagenomic Linkage Groups (MLGs) were established and those with high discriminative power between healthy and neoplastic specimens were analyzed for their genetic content. Also, metagenomic reads from stool samples were mapped against bacterial genes from tissues and reads from tissues were mapped against stools assembled bacterial genes to identify common markers with discriminative power.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000293	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85P57			Investigation of metabolomic blood biomarkers for detection of adenocarcinoma lung cancer	Recently, the National Lung Cancer Screen Trial (NLST) demonstrated that low-dose CT (LDCT) screening could reduce mortality due to lung cancer by 20%. However, LDCT screening is largely hindered by high false-positive rates (96%), particularly in high-risk populations (heavy smokers), due to the low prevalence rates (less than 2%) of malignant tumors and high incidence of benign lung nodules. Consequently, complementary biomarkers that can be used in conjunction with LDCT screening to improve diagnostic capacities and reduce false-positive rates are highly desirable. Preferably, such complementary tools should be noninvasive and exhibit high sensitivity and specificity. The application of “-omic” sciences (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) represents valuable tools for the discovery and validation of potential biomarkers that can be used for detection of NSCLC. Of these omic sciences, metabolomics has received considerable attention for its application in cancer. Metabolomics is the assessment of small molecules and biochemical intermediates (metabolites) using analytic instrumentation. Metabolites in blood are the product of all cellular processes, which are highly responsive to conditions of disease and environment, and represent the final output products of all organs forming a detailed systemic representation of an individual's current physiologic state. In this study, we used an untargeted metabolomics approach using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCTOFMS) to analyze the metabolome of serum and plasma samples both collected from the same patients that were organized into two independent case–control studies (ADC1 and ADC2). In both studies, only NSCLC adenocarcinoma was investigated. The overall objectives were to (i) determine whether individual or combinations of metabolites could be used as a diagnostic test to distinguish NSCLC adenocarcinoma from controls and (ii) to determine which, plasma or serum, provides more accurate classifiers for the detection of lung cancer. We developed individual and multimetabolite classifiers using a training test from the ADC1 study and evaluated the performance of the constructed classifiers, individually or in combination, in an independent test/validation study (ADC2). This study shows the potential of metabolite-based diagnostic tests for detection of lung adenocarcinoma. Further validation in a larger pool of samples is warranted.

However, more global effects of fructose on cellular metabolism have not been elucidated. In order to explore the metabolic impact of fructose-containing nutrients, we applied both GC-TOF and HILIC-QTOF mass spectrometry metabolomic strategies using extracts from cultured HepG2 cells exposed to fructose, glucose, or fructose + glucose. Cellular responses were analyzed in a time-dependent manner, incubated in media containing 5.5 mM glucose + 5.0 mM fructose in comparison to controls incubated in media containing either 5.5 mM glucose or 10.5 mM glucose. Mass spectrometry identified 156 unique known metabolites and a large number of unknown compounds, which revealed metabolite changes due to both utilization of fructose and high-carbohydrate loads independent of hexose structure. Fructose was shown to be partially converted to sorbitol, and generated higher levels of fructose-1-phosphate as a precursor for glycolytic intermediates. Differentially regulated ratios of 3-phosphoglycerate to serine pathway intermediates in high fructose media indicated a diversion of carbon backbones away from energy metabolism. Additionally, high fructoseconditions changed levels of complex lipids toward phosphatidylethanolamines. Patterns of acylcarnitines in response to high hexose exposure (10.5 mM glucose or glucose/fructose combination) suggested a reduction in mitochondrial beta-oxidation.

Our central hypothesis is that IC/PBS-associated metabolites in the urine of IC/PBS patients can segregate patients from control subjects, and that their levels are correlated with clinical symptoms. To test this hypothesis, we will identify IC/PBS-associated metabolites in urine using two independent platforms, GC-MS and quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometry under the collaboration with UC Davis WCMC scientists. We believe that this study will provide a significant potential clinical impact because results may lead to clinical methods to increase diagnostic accuracy and an improved understanding of the molecular basis of IC/PBS and its relationship to urologic conditions with overlapping symptoms.

Understanding the biochemical networks that underlie metabolic homeostasis and how they associate with insulin action will help unravel diabetes etiology and should foster discovery of new biomarkers of disease risk and severity. We examined differences in plasma concentrations of >350 metabolites in fasted obese T2DM vs. obese non-diabetic African-American women, and utilized principal components analysis to identify 158 metabolite components that strongly correlated with fasting HbA1c over a broad range of the latter (r?=??0.631; p<0.0001). In addition to many unidentified small molecules, specific metabolites that were increased significantly in T2DM subjects included certain amino acids and their derivatives (i.e., leucine, 2-ketoisocaproate, valine, cystine, histidine), 2-hydroxybutanoate, long-chain fatty acids, and carbohydrate derivatives. Leucine and valine concentrations rose with increasing HbA1c, and significantly correlated with plasma acetylcarnitine concentrations. It is hypothesized that this reflects a close link between abnormalities in glucose homeostasis, amino acid catabolism, and efficiency of fuel combustion in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. It is speculated that a mechanism for potential TCA cycle inefficiency concurrent with insulin resistance is “anaplerotic stress” emanating from reduced amino acid-derived carbon flux to TCA cycle intermediates, which if coupled to perturbation in cataplerosis would lead to net reduction in TCA cycle capacity relative to fuel delivery.

Recent computed tomography (CT) screening trials showed that it is effective for early detection of lung cancer, but were plagued by high false positive rates. Additional blood biomarker tests designed to complement CT screening and reduce false positive rates are highly desirable. In the current study, we expand upon our initial experimental findings as part of the discovery phase by evaluating metabolites in serum from subjects with benign or malignant SPNs using a combined approach of gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) and hydrophilic liquid chromatography accurate mass quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HILIC-qTOFMS). Furthermore, we evaluated serum collected pre-diagnosis and at-diagnosis of lung cancer in addition to samples obtained post-surgical intervention from subjects with malignant SPNs (post-diagnosis). We hypothesize that our systems biology approach to identify candidate metabolomics biomarkers will ultimately lead to improved early detection of lung cancer and can be used in as a companion blood test to LDCT screening.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000305	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8PG66			Metabolomic markers of altered nucleotide metabolism in early stage adenocarcinoma	Lung cancer has been the leading cause of cancer death in the United States and worldwide for many decades. Low dose spiral computerized tomography (LDCT) is likely to become the first approved screening and early detection test in the upcoming year, but it is plagued by a high false-positive rate. There is a need to develop complementary screening and early detection tools. A blood-based lung cancer signature is an attractive solution. Given that our knowledge of the molecular biology of smoking-induced lung cancer has dramatically increased over the past few years, this approach is plausible. To date, this effort has been focused on the identification of genomic and proteomic signatures with limited success. A broader strategy that incorporates additional cancer traits is needed. It is well recognized that wide coverage of cellular metabolism in cancer could help provide valuable diagnostic biomarkers and potentially identify molecular drivers of tumorigenesis. Recent advances in mass spectrometry have enabled comprehensive metabolomic analyses of lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, and nucleotides within a variety of biologic matrices. Early evidence from metabolomic investigation of cancer has identified many altered biochemical profiles. However, to date, there have been few investigations of lung cancer, and most studies have looked at blood plasma or were limited by small sample sizes with mixed histologies. In the current investigation, gas chromatography time-offlight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF) was used to measure 462 lipid, carbohydrate, amino acid, organic acid, and nucleotide metabolites in 39 malignant and nonmalignant lung tissue pairs from current or former smokers with early stage adenocarcinoma. This study cohort represents patient characteristics and tumor histology most likely to be detected with LDCT screening. We hypothesize that identification of cancer-induced cellular and tissue level biochemical changes can offer a robust method for identification of candidate circulating biomarkers and improve our understanding of biochemical changes involved in adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis.

Metabolic alterations in tumor cells coupled with systemic indicators of the host response to tumor development have the potential to yield blood profiles with clinical utility for diagnosis and monitoring of treatment. We report results from two separate studies using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) to profile metabolites in human blood samples that significantly differ from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinoma and other lung cancer cases. Metabolomic analysis of blood samples from the two studies yielded a total of 437 metabolites, of which 148 were identified as known compounds and 289 identified as unknown compounds. Differential analysis identified 15 known metabolites in one study and 18 in a second study that were statistically different (p-values <0.05). Levels of maltose, palmitic acid, glycerol, ethanolamine, glutamic acid, and lactic acid were increased in cancer samples while amino acids tryptophan, lysine and histidine decreased. Many of the metabolites were found to be significantly different in both studies, suggesting that metabolomics appears to be robust enough to find systemic changes from lung cancer, thus showing the potential of this type of analysis for lung cancer detection.

Signals that are responsive to shifts in LCFA ß-oxidation rate or degree of intramitochondrial catabolism are hypothesized to regulate second messenger systems downstream of the insulin receptor. Recent evidence supports a causal link between mitochondrial LCFA combustion in skeletal muscle and insulin resistance. We have used unbiased metabolite profiling of mouse muscle mitochondria with the aim of identifying candidate metabolites within or effluxed from mitochondria and that are shifted with LCFA combustion rate. This proof-of-principle study establishes that large-scale metabolomics methods can be applied to organelle-level models to discover metabolite patterns reflective of LCFA combustion, which may lead to identification of molecules linking muscle fat metabolism and insulin signaling. Our results suggest that future studies should focus on the fate of effluxed TCA cycle intermediates and on mechanisms ensuring their replenishment during LCFA metabolism in skeletal muscle.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000308	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M82P59			The circadian oscillator in Synechococcus elongatus controls metabolite partitioning during diurnal growth	Cyanobacteria are increasingly being considered for use in large-scale outdoor production of fuels and industrial chemicals. Cyanobacteria can anticipate daily changes in light availability using an internal circadian clock and rapidly alter their metabolic processes in response to changes light availability. Understanding how signals from the internal circadian clock and external light availability are integrated to control metabolic shifts will be important for engineering cyanobacteria for production in natural outdoor environments. This study has assessed how “knowing” the correct time of day, via the circadian clock, affects metabolic changes when a cyanobacterium goes through a dark-to-light transition. Our data show that the circadian clock plays an important role in inhibiting activation of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in the morning. Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 is a genetically tractable model cyanobacterium that has been engineered to produce industrially relevant biomolecules and is the best-studied model for a prokaryotic circadian clock. However, the organism is commonly grown in continuous light in the laboratory, and data on metabolic processes under diurnal conditions are lacking. Moreover, the influence of the circadian clock on diurnal metabolism has been investigated only briefly. Here, we demonstrate that the circadian oscillator influences rhythms of metabolism during diurnal growth, even though light–dark cycles can drive metabolic rhythms independently. Moreover, the phenotype associated with loss of the core oscillator protein, KaiC, is distinct from that caused by absence of the circadian output transcriptional regulator, RpaA (regulator of phycobilisome-associated A). Although RpaA activity is important for carbon degradation at night, KaiC is dispensable for those processes. Untargeted metabolomics analysis and glycogen kinetics suggest that functional KaiC is important for metabolite partitioning in the morning. Additionally, output from the oscillator functions to inhibit RpaA activity in the morning, and kaiC-null strains expressing a mutant KaiC phosphomimetic, KaiC-pST, in which the oscillator is locked in the most active output state, phenocopies a ?rpaA strain. Inhibition of RpaA by the oscillator in the morning suppresses metabolic processes that normally are active at night, and kaiC-null strains show indications of oxidative pentose phosphate pathway activation as well as increased abundance of primary metabolites. Inhibitory clock output may serve to allow secondary metabolite biosynthesis in the morning, and some metabolites resulting from these processes may feed back to reinforce clock timing.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000309	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M86G6V			Lung Cancer Plasma Discovery	Recently, major efforts have been directed toward early detection of lung cancer through low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scanning. Data from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) suggest that yearly screening with thoracic LDCT scanning for high-risk current and former smokers reduces lung cancer mortality by 20% and total mortality by 7%. However, issues including indeterminate nodules detected by LDCT and radiation exposure impact the practicality of LDCT-based screening on a national and global basis. A blood-based biomarker or multiplexed marker panel that could complement LDCT would represent a major advance in implementing lung cancer screening. Efforts to develop blood-based biomarkers for lung cancer early detection using a variety of methodologies are currently ongoing. Proteomic studies have led to the identification of several candidate markers including pro-surfactantproteinB(pro-SFTPB), a target of a lineage-survival oncogene in lung cancer, NKX2-1.Validation studies using blood samples collected at the time of LDCT screening for lung cancer substantiated the performance of pro-SFTPB. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the predictive ability of pro-SFTPB. The area under the curve (AUC) values of the full model with and without pro-SFTPB were 0.741 (95% CI, 0.696 to 0.783) and 0.669 (95%CI, 0.620 to 0.717), respectively (difference in AUC, P_.001). Single markers are unlikely to have sufficient performance for implementation in a screening setting, hence the need to explore several discovery platforms to identify markers that provide complementary performance. Metabolomics represents a global unbiased approach to the profiling of small molecules and has been established as a platform for biomarker discovery for a variety of human biofluids and tissues. Here we used an untargeted liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (MS) metabolomics approach to identify metabolites that distinguish human sera collected before the diagnosis of lung cancer from matched control sera in a prospective cohort of highrisk patients from the Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET).
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000310	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8B602			Long-term neural and physiological phenotyping of a single human	The dynamics of human brain function are increasingly well understood at the short timescale of seconds/minutes (for example, through studies of learning) and the long timescale of years/decades (for example, through studies of development andageing), but almost nothing is known about how the human brainfunction varies across the range of days to months. This is a critical gap, because major psychiatric disorders show large fluctuations in brain function over this timescale. However, the kind of dense longitudinal phenotyping that is necessary to understand this question is extremely challenging with healthy human volunteers,who are unlikely to be sufficiently motivated to sustain frequent participation in a study over a long period. For this reason, the participation of motivated experimenters can be uniquely useful for demanding longitudinal studies. We investigated the long-range dynamics of brain function andtheir relation to a broad set of psychological and biological variables in a single healthy human (author R.A.P.) over the course of 532 days (along with several follow-up visits), representing one of the most intensive biological characterizations of a single individual ever performed (referred to hereafter as the MyConnectomestudy). The study was designed to measure the broadest possible range of human phenotypes (the phenome’3,4) to allow the widespread assessment of relations between psychological, neural and metabolic function. The results of the present study demonstrate that healthy brain function shows rich dynamics over the course of 18 months, and that these dynamics are paralleled by ongoing fluctuations in psychological and physiological function as observed in behaviour,gene expression and metabolomic measurements. These findings provide a proof of concept for the dynamic longitudinal phenotyping of individuals, which we propose will be crucial togain a better understanding of the substantial fluctuations in psychological and neural function in individuals with major psychiatric disorders.

We previously observed that the model bacteria, Escherichia coli, enhanced the growth and substrate uptake of the green algae, Auxenochlorella protothecoides. We hypothesized that this growth enhancement was due to the secretion of thiamine derivatives or degradation products by E. coli followed by uptake of these compounds by A. protothecoides. Targeted and untargeted LCMS revealed the presence of thiamine dervatives in E. coli cell extracts. These LCMS methods were also used to quantify thiamine derivatives and two degradation products, HMP and THZ, present in E. coli medium after cell removal. The LCMS results along with culture studies were employed to show that thiamine derivatives and degradation products were the primary mechanism of symbiosis between E. coli and A. protothecoides.

In this study, we would like to investigate the inhibition of an enzyme called diamine oxidase (DAO) (also known as ABP1), by metformin. Based on our preliminary in vitro study using diamine oxidase enzyme, we saw increased level of putrescine with increasing metformin concentrations (see reference PMID: 26335661). This proposed in vivo study was to determine whether metformin could increase putrescine levels and other metabolites in mice. Aminoguanidine, a known inhibitor of DAO, in this study as positive control, following similar study design described in this paper (PMID: 8912017).

This disorder is associated with pre-term delivery, fetal death, maternal hemorrhagic shock, and renal failure. Several physiologic disturbances, such as oxidative stress, carbohydrate/fatty acid metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction, have been associated with ischemic placental disorder as well as with placental abruption. This preliminary study proposes to identify metabolites associated with incident placental abruption using existing serum and clinical data from a previously studied cohort. Metabolomics analysis will be carried out on maternal serum (51 cases and 51 controls) collected in early pregnancy (early second trimester).

In highly exposed populations, altered immunity is one of the most affected pathways and can lead to an elevated risk of infection and a pre-disposition to allergy/atopy. Since well water in the New Hampshire region has been determined to be a potential source of As exposure, this study includes mother-infant dyads living in the area, who obtain household water from private wells. This study seeks to determine if in utero and early life As exposure is related to increase occurrence of childhood: infections, allergy and atopy, and diminished vaccine response. It has been observed that the microbiome is an important mediator of immune impairment due to As exposure. Therefore, we will further investigate the relation between in utero and early life As exposure on the development of the infant intestinal microbiome in the first year of life. For this study fecal samples, from infants at risk of As exposure, were collected at 6 weeks and 12 months of age. Metabolomics data will allow for a more complete picture of the relationships between the microbiome, As exposure and immune function.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000320	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8MP4W			Metabolomic analysis of oxytocin effects on social deficits in mice	The goal of this study was to determine the effects of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) on metabolomic profiles, using a mouse model of autism-like behavior, the BALB/cByJ inbred strain. We have previously reported that subchronic treatment with OT can lead to persistent reversal of social deficits in BALB/cByJ and other models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this study, mice were given a subchronic regimen with either vehicle or OT, and then evaluated for social approach. At the end of the study, brain and blood were collected for metabolomic analysis. In addition, fecal samples were taken at different time points during the treatment and testing regimen. The results from this project could elucidate mechanisms underlying the prosocial effects of oxytocin, and identify new targets for the development of highly specific oxytocin-related drugs.

The transplantation of donation after circulatory death (DCD) livers is limited by poor outcomes, but its application may be expanded by ex vivo repair and assessment of the organ before transplantation. Here we employed subnormothermic (21 °C) machine perfusion of discarded human livers combined with metabolomics to gain insight into metabolic recovery during machine perfusion. Improvements in energetic cofactors and redox shifts were observed, as well as reversal of ischemia-induced alterations in selected pathways, including lactate metabolism and increased TCA cycle intermediates. We next evaluated whether DCD livers with steatotic and severe ischemic injury could be discriminated from ‘transplantable’ DCD livers. Metabolomic profiling was able to cluster livers with similar metabolic patterns based on the degree of injury. Moreover, perfusion parameters combined with differences in metabolic factors suggest variable mechanisms that result in poor energy recovery in injured livers. We conclude that machine perfusion combined with metabolomics has significant potential as a clinical instrument for the assessment of preserved livers.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000326	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8C31Q			Controlled Human Exposure to Particulate matter (PM) and Gaseous Co-Pollutants	During the past decade, several epidemiological studies have reported statistically significant positive correlations between daily concentrations of ambient air particles and acutely increased mortality and morbidity. It has been estimated that 50,000 - 60,000 excess deaths in the U.S. each year may be attributable to ambient particles. Several panel studies have reported associations between fine PM and decreased heart rate variability and increased vascular markers of inflammation. In addition, recent controlled human exposure studies have reported that fine particles can increase pulmonary inflammation, decrease heart rate variability, and increase vascular factors of inflammation and blood coagulation. However, these latter studies only assessed the effects of particulate matter. In the real world, people are simultaneously exposed to both gaseous pollutants (e.g. ozone, nitrogen dioxide) and particles. Recognition of this leads the National Research Council to list studies of PM and gaseous co-pollutants as one of the ten highest priorities in PM research. One of these co-pollutants that frequently occur together with PM is nitrogen oxides (NOx), which is produced during combustion processes. NOx consists of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). NO dominates near roadsides and peaks in morning rush hours while NO2 levels show less temporal and spatial variability. NO and NO2 concentrations may reach values over 1 ppm and 0.5 ppm respectively during smog situations. NO2 is an oxidant capable of oxidizing and nitrating lipids and proteins and can cause cytotoxic effects on the cell membranes of epithelial cells as well as macrophages. Controlled exposure of healthy humans to 2 ppm NO2 reduced phagocytic capacity in macrophages. At similar concentrations controlled NO2 exposure produced small changes in large airway function and increased airway reactivity to methacholine. The inflammatory effects of NO2 may thus enhance the adverse effects of PM. In this study we hypothesize that NO2 and PM2.5 affect the cardiopulmonary system beyond what either pollutant is capable of inducing by itself. Cardiopulmonay impairment will be assessed by measuring changes in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophils and cytokines, heart rate variability, and plasma factors involved in inflammation and coagulation.

To this end, five cystic fibrosis children homozygous for ?Phe508 were to be recruited with their heterozygous non-CF mothers. Unstimulated glandular secretions to include parotid and submandibular/sublingual saliva samples as well as whole, mixed saliva collected with masticatory stimulation were to be collected from the child and the mother and analyzed for nitrate (NO3), nitrite (NO2), bicarbonate (HCO3), thiocyanate (SCN), reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG) and buffering capacity (pH before and after addition of HCl to 3.75mN). For adaptation and development of the assays to a microtiter format, saliva samples were collected from non-CF control subjects initially to optimize the assays recognizing that the volumes for analyses would be small. The values obtained with these non-CF control samples were also compared to that of the homozygous and heterozygous CF subjects. As residual volume permits, these samples will be further analyzed for metabolic constituent profiles.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000328	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8MK6M			Impact Of High Sugar Diet On L-Arginine Metabolism In The Lung	Asthma is a progressive inflammatory airways disease that leads to structural airway changes and debilitating symptoms in many severely affected adults. We need novel therapeutic agents that are affordable, can decrease the reliance on steroids, and can improve quality of life. This clinical and mechanistic study has the potential to impact treatment of a subset of adult severe asthmatics and to further our understanding of the mechanisms of L-arginine metabolism and NO biology in the airways of asthmatics. We will pursue a clinical trial in subjects not well controlled on standard drug therapy; this strategy will address whether L-arginine is efficacious in patients receiving standard of care medications. In studies using animal models, we and others have shown that interventions that augment NO levels, through either supplementation of L-arginine or inhibition of arginase, decrease allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness-the two hallmarks of asthma. Overall, we hypothesize that a responder subset of adult severe asthma patients will derive clinical benefit from supplemental L-arginine therapy and that these patients will have a lower exhaled NO concentrations (<20 ppb) and a higher NOS2/Arg1 mRNA and protein ratio in their airway epithelial cells than non-responders. We aim to: 1) test the hypothesis that uncontrolled, adult severe asthma patients with exhaled breath NO concentrations <20 ppb will have fewer asthma exacerbations over 3 months when treated with L-arginine compared to patients with FeNO > 25, 2) determine the mechanisms by which L-arginine affects the regulation of NOS and arginase enzymes in primary airway epithelial cell cultures from severe asthmatic subjects, and 3) test the hypothesis that inhaled nanoparticle carrier formulations of L-arginine will decrease airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway fibrosis at lower doses than systemically administered L-arginine. The major impact of our study will be to identify the adult severe asthma cohort that will benefit from supplemental L-arginine therapy. Our ultimate goal is to develop novel therapeutic agents to treat adult severe asthma patients better. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is a progressive inflammatory airways disease that leads to structural airway changes and debilitating symptoms in many severely affected adults. This clinical study has the potential to improve the care of adult severe asthmatics and to further our understanding of the mechanisms of L-arginine metabolism and nitric oxide biology in the lung. If we demonstrate that L-arginine supplementation can decrease asthma attacks in a subset of severe asthmatics, it will have great implications for future research as well as for the daily lives of patients with asthma.

Mycoplasmas are eubacteria, but have only a single plasma membrane and no cell wall. They acquire FAs and cholesterol and other (perhaps many unknown) lipids from the medium which is complex and contains mammalian serum. Various mycoplasma species have been shown to contain a wide spectrum of bacterial lipids, but the composition is unknown for this mycoplasma species. We are particularly interested in ratios of membrane lipids among our strains, in part to gain clues about differences in metabolic pathways pertinent to membrane biogenesis; and to predict any underlying features that could relate to the extremely different modes of cell propagation observed among these genomic constructs.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000333	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M88885			The ubiquitin ligase MuRF1 regulates PPAR? activity in the heart by enhancing nuclear export via monoubiquitination	The transcriptional regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) a by post-translational modification, such as ubiquitin, has not been described. We report here for the first time an ubiquitin ligase (muscle ring finger-1/MuRF1) that inhibits fatty acid oxidation by inhibiting PPARa, but not PPARß/d or PPAR? in cardiomyocytes in vitro. Similarly, MuRF1 Tg+ hearts showed significant decreases in nuclear PPARa activity and acyl-carnitine intermediates, while MuRF1-/- hearts exhibited increased PPARa activity and acyl-carnitine intermediates. MuRF1 directly interacts with PPARa, mono-ubiquitinates it, and targets it for nuclear export to inhibit fatty acid oxidation in a proteasome independent manner. We then identified a previously undescribed nuclear export sequence in PPARa, along with three specific lysines (292, 310, 388) required for MuRF1's targeting of nuclear export. These studies identify the role of ubiquitination in regulating cardiac PPARa, including the ubiquitin ligase that may be responsible for this critical regulation of cardiac metabolism in heart failure.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000334	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8D02C			C2C12 stretch cessation models muscle atrophy and anaplerotic changes in metabolism	Studies of skeletal muscle disuse either in patients on bed rest or experimentally in animals(immobilization) have demonstrated that decreased protein synthesis is common, with transient parallel increases in protein degradation. Muscle disuse atrophy involves a process of transition from slow to fast myosin fiber types 6 . A shift toward glycolysis, decreased capacity for fat oxidation, and substrate accumulation in atrophied muscles have been reported as has accommodation of the liver with an increased gluconeogenic capacity. Recent studies have modeled skeletal muscle disuse by using cyclic stretch of differentiated myotubes (C2C12), which mimics the loading pattern of mature skeletal muscle, followed by cessation of stretch.We utilized this model to determine the metabolic changes using non-targeted metabolomics analysis of the media. We identified increases in amino acids resulting from protein degradation (largely sarcomere) that occurs with muscle atrophy that are involved in feeding the Kreb’s cycle through anaplerosis. Specifically, we identified increased alanine/proline metabolism (significantly elevated proline, alanine, glutamine, and asparagine) and increased ?-ketoglutaric acid, the proposed Kreb’s cycle intermediate being fed by the alanine/proline metabolic anaplerotic mechanism. Additionally, several unique pathways not clearly delineated in previous studies of muscle unloading were seen, including: 1) elevated ethanolamine and elevated keto-acids (e.g. 2-ketoleucine and 2-keovaline) represent intermediates in the Ehlrich amino acid degradation pathway, which feeds into a metabolic pathway supplying acetyl-CoA and 2-hydroxybutyrate (also significantly increased); and 2) elevated guanine, an intermediate of purine metabolism, was seen at 12 hours unloading. Given the interest in targeting different aspects of the ubiquitin proteasome system to inhibit protein degradation, this C2C12 system may allow the identification of direct and indirect alterations in metabolism due to anaplerosis or through other yet to be identified mechanisms using a non-targeted metabolomics approach.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000338	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8X01N			Characterizing commonalities and differences between the breast and prostate cancer metabotypes in African-American cohorts	Many attempts have been made to identify critical events responsible for the development and progression of breast cancer (BCa). In spite of this, the mechanisms underlying notably tumor invasion and BCa dissemination remain largely unclear. The pathological features of BCa follow a sequential progression from the transformation of a normal cell to benign proliferation, hyperplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and metastatic diseases. It has been reported that the disease phenotype is distinguishable in ADH and progresses along distinct pathways for each subtype. The genetic signature for disease heterogeneity across subtypes is greater than the heterogeneity of progression from DCIS to IDC within a subtype, suggesting that the disease subtypes have distinct progression pathways. Even so, genetics does not fully explain etiology nor progression. Additionally, a large population based study reported an increased risk of male BCa after prostate cancer (PCa). The two cancers share similarities with a wide heterogeneity of both phenotype and biology. A unique feature of PCa and BCa is that at least in the initial stages, they are hormone-dependent and have remarkable underlying biological similarities. Our recent study and others showed an increased level of common metabolites in BCa and PCa. Thus, understanding the metabolic profiles of breast and prostate cancer would pave the way for new biomarkers to improve diagnosis and treatment strategies.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000339	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M81S4N			Metabotypes of Subjects with Adverse Reactions Following Vaccination: A Pilot Study	An Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) is an adverse reaction to a vaccination that goes above and beyond the usual side effects that are known to be associated with vaccinations. AEFIs can vary in clinical severity to very mild to incapacitating and occasionally require lost time from work or even hospitalization. In rare cases, there is an aberrant immune reaction from vaccination resulting in a potentially serious adverse event. One known serious adverse event related to the smallpox vaccine is myocarditis and/or pericarditis (myopericarditis). Metabolomics may help identify a particular metabolic signature “metabotype” in patients who are predisposed to developing AEFI such as a systemic reaction, or myocarditis that currently is difficult or impossible to identify prior to the development of the AEFI. This proposed pilot study looks at the metabolic profiles of a specific population of subjects who received the smallpox vaccine with or without other concomitantly administered vaccines to help determine if a unique metabotype can be identified in subjects who reported systemic reactions following immunization. In addition, this proposed study will look at the metabolic profile of several subjects with subclinical or clinically diagnosed myopericarditis to determine if these subjects have a unique metabotype. The ability to identify a unique metabotype would allow a clinician to potentially mitigate serious AEFI and ultimately improve the quality of immunization healthcare. If identified, these profiles might represent novel biomarkers of risk that can supplement existing clinical decision making for risk stratification or vaccine exemptions.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000341	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8989V			Metabolomics Analysis of Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cell Lines	To date there are no clinically approved targeted therapies for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). In addition to the absence of estrogen, progesterone, and HER2/neu receptors, TNBCs possess characteristics that make them some of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer (BCa). In terms of epidemiology, breast cancers with the triple negative profile present at a higher prevalence in premenopausal women under the age of 40, usually with a BMI greater than 30, and have higher incidences of mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Additionally, several studies have shown a higher prevalence in African American women, demonstrating a health disparity. In spite of this knowledge and the fact that most people respond to initial chemotherapeutic treatment, lasting treatment modalities used for the cure and maintenance of other BCa subtypes generally fail to significantly increase disease-free survival or diminish the rates of recurrence within the first five years after initial detection of TNBC. Our ultimate goal is to identify novel biomarkers which may be leveraged for initiating prevention strategies in high risk populations, earlier detection, or targeted treatment of this disease.

There have been reported a series of natural apratoxin derivatives with defined chemical modifications in their structures that alter their biological activity. Looking for a better activity, total synthesis of apratoxin has been achieved and a series of synthetic congeners showed increased activity with subnanomolar potency. From the total synthesis point of view, the modification of the polyketide backbone presents a burden for a radical derivatization of apratoxins. We hypothesized that supply the polyketide part naturally by overexpression the corresponding genes it will facilitate the generation of apratoxin congeners by decorating the backbone with a variety of amino acids improving the antitumor activity.Threfore, the apratoxin gene cluster was recovered from a fosmid DNA library. The gene set responsible for the biosynthesis of the polyketide backbone was introduced in E. coli BAP strain and expressed at 30C for 24 hours. Two sets of control and experimental samples with culture broth pH adjusted at 8 and 12 respectively was extracted with ethyl acetate and dried.

We performed targeted, broad-spectrum metabolomics to gain insights into the biology of CFS. We studied a total of 84 subjects using these methods. Forty-five subjects (n = 22 men and 23 women) met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS by Institute of Medicine, Canadian, and Fukuda criteria. We targeted 612 metabolites in plasma from 63 biochemical pathways by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization, and tandem mass spectrometry in a single-injection method. Our data show that despite the heterogeneity of factors leading to CFS, the cellular metabolic response in patients was homogeneous, statistically robust, and chemically similar to the evolutionarily conserved persistence response to environmental stress known as dauer.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000349	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8XS4Q			The alpha-1A adrenergic receptor agonist A61603 reduces cardiac polyunsaturated fatty acid	Introduction Alpha-1-adrenergic receptors (a1-ARs) are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) with three highly homologous subtypes (a1A, a1B, and a1D). Of these three subtypes, only the a1A and a1B are expressed in the heart. Multiple pre-clinical models of heart injury demonstrate cardioprotective roles for the a1A. Non-selective a1-AR activation promotes glycolysis in the heart, but the functional a1-AR subtype and broader metabolic effects have not been studied. Objectives Given the high metabolic demands of the heart and previous evidence indicating benefit from a1A activation, we chose to investigate the effects of a1A activation on the cardiac metabolome in vivo. Methods Mice were treated for 1 week with a low, subpressor dose of A61603, a highly selective and potent a1A agonist. Cardiac tissue and serum were analyzed using a non-targeted metabolomics approach. Results We identified previously unrecognized metabolic responses to a1A activation,most notably broad reduction in the abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids(PUFAs) and endocannabinoids (ECs). Conclusion Given the well characterized roles of PUFAs and ECs in inflammatory pathways, these findings suggest a possible role for cardiac a1A-ARs in the regulation of inflammation and may offer novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective benefit of selective pharmacologic a1A activation.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000350	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8T30C			Metabolic Adaptation of Staphylococcus aureus to Host Immunity	Staphylococcus aureus infections are difficult to treat given the drug-resistant nature of this bacterium. Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is considered the single most deadly bacterial infection in the United States. The bacterium resists nearly every aspect of innate immunity, including the cytotoxic effects of nitric oxide (NO?) which is an innate immune effector produced by phagocytes in response to infection. NO? interferes with various metabolic pathways in pathogens by reacting with redox centers of multiple enzymes. We have demonstrated that S. aureus NO?-resistance is essential for full virulence. We have also shown that S. aureus NO-resistance is predicated on the abundance of glucose, which may explain exacerbated S. aureus disease outcomes associated with diabetic patients having poorly controlled blood sugar. Here we propose to employ metabolomics to probe the nature of the S. aureus NO-resistant metabolic state. We will thereby bridge a fundamental gap in our knowledge of S. aureus pathogenesis by defining metabolic pathways essential to cause disease in immunocompetent hosts. These key metabolic pathways represent important therapeutic targets for future research. Define the requirement for glycolytic carbon/energy sources for the S. aureus NO-RMS: While S. aureus can thrive on a variety of gluconeogenic carbon sources (e.g. amino acids, glycerol, lactate etc.), none of these are capable of supporting NO?-resistance. We will compare changes in intracellular metabolites in cells growing on gluconeogenic carbon sources following NO?-exposure to elucidate what features of gluconeogenesis are incompatible with NO?-resistance. The absolute requirement for glycolytic carbon sources for NO-resistance is interesting given the disproportionately poor disease outcomes of MRSA infections in diabetic patients with elevated blood glucose.

Currently, no successful treatment or preventative measure exists for AD. Calorie restriction (CR) is a dietary regimen posited to suppress genetic programs of aging and reduce AD-related pathology. CR is known to enhance longevity and mitigate aging phenotypes in multiple model species. Mechanisms underlying the benefits of CR remain unknown, particularly in areas of the brain selectively vulnerable to age-related AD pathology such as the hippocampus, a region crucial for learning and memory. Moreover, AD pathology can be influenced by changes in diet, metabolism, and immunity, indicating that factors distant from the brain may play a role in pathogenesis. The intestinal microbiota, composed of trillions of microbial cells, influences host metabolism, immunity, and cognitive function, and is posited to be linked mechanistically to AD pathobiology, but a specific role remains to be adequately tested. We hypothesize that mechanisms underlying the benefits of CR are cell-type and organ specific, involving the gut-brain microbiome throughout the lifespan, this requiring subregional analysis in the brain as well as coordinated assessments of key peripheral targets including the liver, fecal pellets , and plasma. Thus, CR is proposed to be a viable treatment option that may ameliorate the development of AD-related pathology, and importantly, reveal mechanisms that attenuate age-related expression changes in vulnerable cells.

Screening of plant extracts in search of new anti-cancer agents resulted in the discovery of englerin A, a guaiane sesquiterpene with potent cytotoxicity against renal cancer cells and a small subset of other cancer cells. the current study used a systems biology approach to explore the mechanism(s) of action of engerin A at a more global level.Our metabolomics analyses indicated that englerin A profoundly altered lipid metabolism in cc-RCC cell lines and generated significant levels of ceramides that were highly toxic to these cells. Microarray analyses determined that englerin A induced ER stress signaling and an acute inflammatory response, which was confirmed by quantitative PCR and Western Blot analyses.Our findings suggest that cc-RCC is highly sensitive to disruptions in lipid metabolism and ER stress and that these vulnerabilities can be targeted for the treatment of cc-RCC and possibly other lipid storing cancers.

The importance of the fecal metabolome has more recently been appreciated, but our knowledge of the microbiome and metabolome at other sites along the gastrointestinal tract remains deficient. Objective: To analyze the gastrointestinal microbiome and metabolome of healthy domestic dogs at four anatomical sites. Methods: Samples of the duodenal, ileal, colonic, and rectal contents were collected from six adult dogs after humane euthanasia for an unrelated study. The microbiota were characterized using Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The metabolome was characterized by mass spectrometry-based methods. Results: Prevalent phyla throughout the samples were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, consistent with previous findings in dogs and other species. A total of 530 unique metabolites were detected; 199 of these were identified as previously named compounds, but 141 of them had at least one significantly different site-pair comparison. Noteworthy examples include amino acids, which decreased from the small to large intestine; pyruvate, which was at peak concentrations in the ileum; and several phenol-containing carboxylic acid compounds that increased in the large intestine. Conclusion: The microbiome and metabolome vary significantly at different sites along the canine gastrointestinal tract.

We hypothesized that the identification of the relationships between blood metabolome, transcriptome and miRNome during endurance exercise could provide significant insights into the molecular response to intense exercise or prediction of this response at basal status. In this perspective, the serum metabolome and whole-blood transcriptome and miRNome data were obtained from 10 horses before and after a 160 km endurance competition. Results: We obtained a global regulatory network based on 11 unique metabolites, 263 metabolic genes and 5 miRNAs whose expression was significantly altered at T1 (post- endurance competition) relative to T0 (baseline, pre- endurance competition). This network provided new insights into the cross talk between the distinct molecular pathways (e.g. energy and oxygen sensing, oxidative stress, and inflammation) that were not detectable when analyzing single metabolites or transcripts alone. This suggested that single metabolites and transcripts were carrying out multiple roles and thus sharing several biochemical pathways. Using a regulatory impact factor metric analysis, this regulatory network was further confirmed at the transcription factor and miRNA levels. In an extended cohort of 39 animals, multiple factor analysis confirmed the strong associations between lactate, methylene derivatives, miR-21-5p, miR-16-5p, and genes that coded proteins involved in metabolic reactions primarily related to energy, ubiquitin proteasome and lipopolysaccharide immune responses at T1. Multiple factorial analyses also identified potential biomarkers at T0 for an increased possibility of failure to finish an endurance competition.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000383	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8JG7B			Mayo Metabolomics Pilot and Feasibility Award: Role of muscle insulin and IGF-1 signaling on serum and muscle metabolite profiles	Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is a cardinal feature of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Insulin and IGF-1 signal through their highly related receptors to impact on many aspects of muscle physiology including glucose homeostasis, protein metabolism, and mitochondrial function. Early physiological studies, as well as recent large scale metabolomic studies, have shown that changes in specific pools of circulating amino acid metabolites, such as branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), are associated with insulin resistance and can predict future diabetes, but the source and impact of these changes in amino acids are not fully understood. We have recently generated mice which lack insulin receptors (IR) or IGF-1 receptors (IGF1R) or both in muscle using Cre lox recombination. We find that mice which lack only IR or only IGF1R in muscle show minimal changes in muscle mass, but do display increases in proteasomal activity and autophagy in muscle. On the other hand, mice with combined loss of both IR and IGF1R display markedly decreased muscle mass and enhanced degradation pathways, associated with increased protein synthesis, and display changes in mitochondrial gene regulation, indicating that both receptors can compensate to some extent for loss of the other. We hypothesize that IR and IGF1R signaling in muscle coordinate amino acid metabolite turnover and fuel substrate/mitochondrial metabolism, and that in insulin resistant states, changes in protein metabolism and mitochondrial function disrupt relative proportions of amino acid metabolites, which in turn contribute to diabetes risk and/or muscle pathology. We propose to test this hypothesis by performing large scale metabolomics on serum and muscle from mice lacking IR, IGF1R or both in muscle, and we will compare these changes to both insulin deficient streptozotocin-treated and insulin resistant diet-induced obese mouse models. To gain insight into which pathways are critical for metabolite changes, we will also treat mice with specific inhibitors of mTOR, a common protein synthesis pathway, as well as inhibitors of autophagy or proteasomal degradation and determine metabolite concentrations in muscle and serum. These studies will identify specific pathways that impact amino acid and mitochondrial metabolite flux which are perturbed in insulin resistant states, and potentially provide insights into how changes in amino acid metabolites contribute to diabetes risk.

Two key contributors to the increased risk of CVD in middle-aged and older (MA/O) adults are stiffening of the large elastic arteries and the development of vascular endothelial dysfunction, indicated by impaired nitric oxide (NO)-induced endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD). The mechanisms by which aging causes arterial dysfunction are incompletely understood, but involve reductions in NO bioavailability associated with the development of oxidative stress and inflammation. Thus, establishing novel strategies to reduce arterial stiffness and increase vascular endothelial function in MA/O adults by increasing NO bioavailability and reducing oxidative stress and inflammation are a high biomedical research priority. Curcumin is a naturally occurring phenol found in the Indian spice turmeric that improves physiological function in animal models of age-related diseases and is a promising nutraceutical for intervention for promoting healthy aging. Our preclinical results indicate that chow supplemented with curcumin reduces aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), the most common and clinically important measure of large elastic artery stiffness, restores NO-mediated EDD and reduces arterial oxidative stress and inflammation in old C57/BL6 mice. Preliminary data from our recently funded NIH R21 pilot grant indicate that curcumin supplementation improves vascular function in humans. It is possible that changes in the circulating (plasma) metabolome with oral curcumin supplementation will provide insight into novel metabolic mechanisms by which curcumin may improve vascular function. The goal of this project is to identify key metabolic pathways that change with oral curcumin supplementation and to relate those changes with improvements in vascular function in MA/O adults with initial endothelial dysfunction. Metabolomic analysis of plasma samples at baseline also may produce unique molecular signatures that predict responsiveness (changes in vascular function) to curcumin supplementation among individuals.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000388	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8WP4C			Regulation of Metabolism by LSR	Breast cancer is a global crisis, accounting for nearly one quarter of all cancers in women. In the U.S., African-American (AA) women suffer disproportionately from breast cancer mortality compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Both social (socioeconomic factors, diet, obesity) and biological hypotheses (gene polymorphisms, gene expression profiling) have been advanced to explain these discrepancies, but the differences remain poorly understood. Multiple aspects of tumor aggressiveness have been identified in the AA population, including a high proportion of basal-like tumors. Basal-like tumors are clinically the most aggressive, characterized by enhanced cancer stem cell-like features. Currently, no effective molecular therapies exist for these highly aggressive cancers and patient survival is poor. Escalating this disparity is the disease promoting effects of obesity and metabolic syndrome, which are significantly higher in AA women. Obesity and its associated inflammation have been attributed to poor patient outcomes, resistance to chemotherapeutics, and/or cancer risk. A meta-analysis of 43 studies of obesity and breast cancer revealed that obese patients were 33% more likely than non-obese patients to die of breast cancer. Yet apart from correlative studies, no reports have combined these factors with cancer disparities to ascertain their molecular interactions and physiology on breast tumorigenesis. We tested the integration these factors, with focus on a specific molecule, Lipolysis Stimulated Lipoprotein Receptor (LSR), in the promotion of aggressive cancer behaviors. LSR is a cell surface molecule that regulates post-prandial lipid uptake in the liver, is sensitive to high fat diets, and is regulated by metabolic cues, including leptin. By testing each of these factors as well as their dynamic interactions on breast cancer tumorigenesis, we will gain valuable insight into biological mechanisms that influence cancer risk/disparities, response to therapy, and ultimately patient outcome. We recently reported LSR is overexpressed in breast tumors, directs aggressive breast cancer cell behaviors including proliferation and migration, and enhances cancer stem cell-like and chemotherapeutic resistance features in breast cancer cells.

The aim of the current study is to use lipidomics to evaluate the anti-diabetic efficacy of DG extract and its major compounds and to interpret the drug targets and mechanisms. DG is a typical “heat clearing” herb in TCM, and has long been used as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. Phytochemicals with KK structure are the predominant constituents in DG extract, and KK01 is the major form, with a content of around 2% of dry herb. To verify that KK01 is the bioactive compound responsible for the effect of DG, we designed an animal experiment to investigate the efficacies of DG and KK01 on db/db mice in comparison to two first-line anti-diabetic drugs, metformin and rosiglitazone. It was found that after 9 weeks of treatments, KK01 was effective in inhibiting the increase of blood glucose of db/db mice, with effects comparable to metformin and rosiglitazone. To understand the mechanism, the mice blood was collected in fasting status, and the serum was separated and divided into three aliquots for lipidomics, cytokine array and Biocrates analysis. This study will focus on lipidomics analysis.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end stage renal disease, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. The pathophysiology of DN includes both glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage. Meprins are metalloproteinases which are most abundantly expressed in the brush border membranes of proximal kidney tubules. Meprins are also expressed in leukocytes (monocytes and macrophages) and podocytes. Meprins have been implicated in the pathology of acute and chronic kidney injury. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the meprin ß gene were associated in human DN in the Pima Indians, suggesting a role for meprins in the pathophysiology of DN. The current study was done to determine the mechanisms by which meprins modulate the progression of DN in mice.

Despite increasing evidence that the composition and function of the murine intestinal microbiota can substantially influence a broad range of experimental outcomes, relatively little is known about microbiome dynamics within experimental mouse populations. We investigated changes in the intestinal microbiome between C57BL/6J mice spanning six generations (assessed at generations 1, 2, 3 and 6), following their introduction to a stringently controlled facility. Faecal microbiota composition and function were assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, respectively. Significant divergence of the intestinal microbiota between founder and second generation mice, as well as continuing inter-generational variance, was observed. Bacterial taxa whose relative abundance changed significantly included Akkermansia, Turicibacter and Bifidobacterium (p< 0.05), all of which are recognised as having the potential to substantially influence host physiology. Shifts in microbiota composition were mirrored by corresponding differences in the faecal metabolome (r=0.57, p=0.0001), with notable differences in levels of tryptophan pathway metabolites and amino acids, including glutamine, glutamate and aspartate. The magnitude of these changes in the intestinal microbiota and metabolome characteristics during acclimation were on a scale with those observed between populations housed in separate facilities, which differed in regards to husbandry, barrier conditions and dietary intake. The microbiome variance reported here has major implications for experimental reproducibility, and as a consequence, experimental design and the interpretation of research outcomes across as wide range of contexts.

The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from “The common feature of leukemia-associated IDH1 and IDH2 mutations is a neomorphic enzyme activity converting alpha-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate” by Ward and colleagues, published in Cancer Cell in 2010 (Ward et al., 2010). The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 2, 3 and 5. Ward and colleagues demonstrate the mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), commonly found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), abrogate the enzyme’s wild-type activity and confer to the mutant neomorphic activity that produces the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) (Figures 2 and 3). They then show that elevated levels of 2-HG are correlated with mutations in IDH1 and IDH2in AML patient samples (Figure 5). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange and the results of the replications will be published by eLife.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000411	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8XG7R			Metabolomics of immunoglobulin-producing cells in IgA nephropathy	IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most common primary glomerulonephritis, is characterized by deposits of IgA-containing immune complexes in the kidney glomeruli, as first described by Berger and Hinglais in 1968. IgAN is a major cause of end-stage renal disease with its associated cardio-renal morbidity and mortality. Analyses of the IgA deposits revealed that the IgA is exclusively of the IgA1 subclass and that this IgA1 is aberrantly glycosylated, deficient in galactose in some O-glycans (Gd-IgA1). Patients with IgAN have elevated serum levels of Gd-IgA1 bound by anti-glycan autoantibodies in circulating immune complexes (CIC) that are fundamental in driving disease pathology in an autoimmune process. We have recently shown that elevated serum levels of Gd-IgA1 in patients with IgAN predict disease progression. Thus, understanding the mechanisms behind Gd-IgA1 production will improve future treatment options, as there is presently no disease-specific therapy. A total of 24 cell pellets (4 replicates from 6 cell lines) were analyzed by LCMS metabolomics. Immortalized immunoglobulin-producing cell lines were generated from peripheral-blood lymphocytes from patients with IgAN and healthy controls as described in Suzuki, H., Moldoveanu, Z., Hall, S., et al. IgA1-secreting cell lines from patients with IgA nephropathy produce aberrantly glycosylated IgA1. J Clin Invest. 2008, 118, 629-639.

We have utilized gas chromatography-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) metabolite profiling to characterize tomato seeds during dry and imbibed stages using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of Solanum lycopersicum x Solanum pimpinellifolium. In this article we describe, for the first time in tomato, the use of a generalized genetical genomics (GGG) model to study metabolite changes in tomato seeds incorporating genetics as well as environmental effects in a single QTL analysis. The GGG design was used to map genetic quantitative trait loci (G QTLs) and environmental changes by genetic-by-environment interactions (G x E QTLs). A significant canonical correlation was found between metabolites and seed quality traits, revealing a close link between seed quality phenotypes and a specific combination of metabolites. Densely connected metabolites were extracted using graph clustering from correlation networks, and the clusters were evaluated by biochemical-pathway enrichment analysis. The evidence from this study suggests that the number of significant correlations varied among individual metabolites and that the obtained clusters were significantly enriched for metabolites involved in specific biochemical pathways. Thus, the methods described here have the potential to reveal regulatory networks that contribute to our understanding of the complex nature of seed quality.

Despite protocols for anemia management in the end stage kidney disease (ESKD) population, a large proportion of patients do not predictably respond to typical doses of EPO. Several recent randomized controlled trials looking to increase hemoglobin in patients with the anemia of renal disease have uncovered many questions about the treatment of anemia with erythropoietic stimulating agents (ESA) not previously addressed in new drug applications or in subsequent research. We sought to test the hypothesis that serum trace metal concentrations correlate with markers of anemia and response to ESA treatment. EDTA-Plasma from 110 hemodialysis patients participating in an NIDDK funded study (R01-01DK091584) were analyzed by ICP-MS for the concentration of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, V, and Zn. Associations were determined between trace metals and gender, race, hemodialysis status, hemoglobin at the time of draw (Hgb), total ESA dose for the month the sample was collected (EPO), and erythropoietin resistance index determined over the 6 months of treatment leading up to sample collection (ERI).

By colonizing adult germ-free mice with the cecal contents of neonatal and adult mice, we show that the neonatal microbiota is impaired in mediating colonization resistance against two major pathogens causing mortality in neonates. The lack of colonization resistance was caused by the absence of Clostridiales in the neonatal microbiota. Administration of Clostridiales, but not Bacteroidales, restored colonization resistance and abrogated intestinal pathology upon pathogen challenge. Conversely, depletion of Clostridiales abolished colonization resistance in adult mice. Furthermore, intragastric administration of Clostridiales protected neonatal mice from pathogen infection. The neonatal bacteria enhanced the ability of these protective Clostridiales to colonize the gut. These results identify the gut microbiota as a critical determinant of increased susceptibility to enteric infection during the neonatal period.

Using previously collected first and second trimester urine samples from this prospective cohort of nearly 800 pregnancies, we designed a nested case control study aimed to determine whether maternal metabolic abnormalities/differences are associated with FGR. To find the patients with fetal growth restriction (FGR), we reviewed de-identified questionnaires and de-identified previously collected data, and performed a growth potential formula considering gestational age, infant gender, maternal and paternal height, and interaction of gestational age with maternal weight. Using a case:control ratio of 1:2, matched on study site, maternal age (± 2 years), parity, and infant's sex, 53 cases were matched to 106 controls for a total of 159 patients, and 318 samples (one in each ttrimester).

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000427	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8VK5D			Mayo Metabolomics Pilot and Feasibility Award: Deciphering cardioprotective effects of mTOR inhibition via metabolite profiling	Cardiomyopathy is the most common cause for sudden death and heart failure with tremendous public health burden in the U.S. Accumulating evidence from both animal models and clinical studies in human transplant patients suggests that partial inhibition of mechanistic Taget of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is a viable avenue for therapeutic intervention. Specifically, we recently showed both compound (rapamycin) treatment and genetic manipulation using a mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) haploinsufficient (mTOR+/-) mutant confers cardiac protection against cardiomyopathies of two different etiologies in zebrafish. Mechanistically, antihypertrophy, anti-apoptosis and proautophagy of mTOR inhibition play important roles in this cardioprotection process. Our central hypothesis is that this mTOR inhibition-mediated cardioprotection is conferred by transcription factor EB (TFEB)-regulated autophagy activation. To test this hypothesis, we propose to pursue a systematic metabolite profiling analysis in the heart upon DOX stress under fine-tuned mTOR inhibition. We expect to define metabolite signatures in different types of cardiomyopathy, metabolite signature for the cardioprotective effects of mTOR inhibition, as well as metabolite signatures for TFEB genetic manipulations. These data will be compared with transcriptome studies to prove functions of TFEB signaling in cardioprotective effects of mTOR inhibition, which shall provide a solid foundation for renewing our current RO1 grant aiming to develop mTOR-based therapy for heart failure.

However, studies reporting experiences with quality-control and method validation are lacking. In this study, we sought to identify and modify steps in GC-MS-based metabolomic profiling of human plasma that could influence metabolite identification and quantification. Our experimental design included two studies: 1) the limiting-dilution study, which investigated the effects of dilution on analyte identification and quantification, and 2) the concentration-specific study, which compared the optimal plasma extract volume established in the first study with the volume used in the current institutional protocol. We confirmed that contaminants, concentration, intra- and inter-experiment variability are major factors influencing metabolite identification and quantification. In addition, we established methods for improved metabolite identification and quantification, which were summarized to provide recommendations for experimental design of GC-MS-based profiling of human plasma.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000430	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8GC82			Mayo Metabolomics Pilot and Feasibility Award: Metabolomics of Exhaled Breath Condensate in Decompensated Heart Failure	Metabolomics is a large-scale approach to monitoring as many as possible of the compounds involved in cellular processes in a single assay to derive metabolic profiles. Compared with genomics or proteomics, metabolomics reflects changes in phenotype and therefore function. Nearly all the blood volume-cardiac output in humans flows through the lungs at a rate of 5L/min and traverses through capillaries with a very thin blood-gas barrier (approximately 2µm, 600–800 nm; in some places <200 nm) to allow sufficient gas diffusion. However, there is evidence that many other biochemicals from the blood can be found in the exhaled air. Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a relatively new, noninvasive method that allows assessment of biochemical profiles that may not only link to airway physiology, but also to other changing processes in the body. The aims of this study are: (1) Working with the Mayo Clinic Metabolomics Resource Core Laboratory to develop the optimal method for performing metabolomics of EBC, (2) Collecting and metabolomic profiling of the EBCs from patients with heart failure; (2) Comparing the profiles of these patients obtained during stable and acute exacerbation periods as well as during recovery from a decompensation; (3) Comparing the profiles of these patients with age and gender matched controls; (4) Correlation of EBC metabolomic profiles with clinical phenotypes. The proposed metabolomics profiles would be obtained from patients involved in IRB approved, ongoing, primarily NIH funded studies focused on understanding pulmonary congestion in heart failure patients. This includes a recently started project capturing patients as they present in the emergency room with decompensated heart failure. Phenotyping for this study includes novel measures of pulmonary capillary recruitment, alveolar-capillary conductance, pulmonary capillary blood volume, thoracic CT imaging combined with in-hospital clinical data, including blood biomarkers such as BNP and catecholamines. Measurements are performed upon admission (within 24hours) and then repeated just prior to dismissal. In addition, we would collect EBC on stable HF patients and in age and gender matched controls healthy controls from our other ongoing studies. The overall aim will be to identify novel patterns or biomarkers for developing a point-of-care test (POC) for tracking disease status in HF patients.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000433	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8330V			PGD2 and other lipid mediator changes in mouse adipose associated with administration of an oral inhibitor of H-PGDS (HQL-79)	This is an additional experiment being added onto a previous mouse feeding study that aimed to identify changes in metabolites that occur in metabolic tissues in the obese state that are long-lasting and not reversed by weight loss. We observed in the previous mice feeding study that levels of PGD2 increased in HFD fed mice and stayed high after the diet switch. Other members of the Prostaglandin family followed a similar trend (15-deoxy PGJ2, PGJ2) and were specific to adipose tissue. Based on previously published data indicating that central injection of PGD2 stimulates food intake, we attempted to observe this effect using an oral PGD2 inhibitor of H-PGDS (HQL-79). In fact, the oral inhibitor of the H-PGDS (HQL-79) administered peripherally (oral gavage in mice at 30mg/kg dose) reduced daily food intake. Mice were divided into two groups termed Vehicle (Control) and HGL-79 (H-PGDS inhibitor). Each group was analyzed for lipid mediator changes (including PGD2) in adipose tissue by the Newman lab. Analytical results generally met quality control criterion with respect to surrogate recoveries and replicate precision. Surrogate recoveries were good for most oxylipins (58-76%), endocannabinoids (53-75%), and fatty acids (36%). Recovery precision was good for most analytes in these profiles, ranging from 6-28% RSD for most surrogates. The precision for the LTB4 surrogate was higher than most others (38%). Analytical precision was assessed by duplicate analysis of two separate study samples. Analytical precision was 62 - 69% of analytes having <30% RSD for all profiles and correlation analysis for the analytes within these samples ranged from 0.90-0.99 R2. The complete data set is in the associated excel file (Osborn HQL-79 – Deliverable Data Newman Lab.xls). There were few statistically significant differences observed when comparing concentrations (pmol/gr) between the control and HGL-79 treatment groups. However, when we compared ratios we saw numerous differences between PGD2 and its metabolite d15-PGJ2 versus other prostaglandins. Specifically, ratios between PGD2 and other connected pathway metabolites indicate a shift toward PGE2 and PGF2a production instead of PGD2 (Figure 1) with HQL-79 treatment. The PGD2 and PGE2 metabolites ratio of d15-PGJ2/15-keto PGE2 was statistically significant (P<0.01) using a two-tailed t-test. The ratios of PGD2/PGE2 and PGD2/PGF2 had p values of P<0.09 and P=0.07), respectively. Considering that we were predicting changes that indicated less PGD2 production it may be justifiable to use one-tailed tests instead. In order to maintain consistency with the metabolomic data analysis in the previous study, I followed the same statistical protocol that Johannes preformed for the main Pilot study. Using R and Devium log transformed data. Since this was a two group comparision, if the data was normal a 2 tailed t-test was used and if not normal then Mann-Whitney was used. A far as the significance of a shift from PGD2 to PGE2 production, I found a nice review article that discusses in detail the role of prostaglandins in white adipose tissue (Flachs et al. 2013). In the review it cites articles that have shown PGE2 to induce UCP1, modulate lipolysis adipogenesis, and stimulate leptin release. On the other hand, PGD2 was shown to increase adipogenesis and weight gain. Its downstream product d15-PGJ2 has been shown to increase adipogenesis, adipocyte differentiation, and decrease leptin production. This is significant since I also observed that the ratio of d15-PGJ2 to 15-keto PGE2 (the downstream product of PGE2) was also decreased. Another prostaglandin whose ratio versus PGD2 was different in the inhibitor group was PGF2a which has been shown to increase glucose transport in adipose tissue.

To automatically extract arrival times for molecules measured by DTIMS at multiple electric fields and compute their associated collisional cross sections (CCS), we created the PNNL Ion Mobility Cross Section Extractor (PIXiE). The primary application presented for this algorithm is the extraction of that can then be used to create a reference library of CCS values for use in high throughput omics analyses. Results: We demonstrate the utility of this approach by automatically extracting arrival times and calculating the associated CCSs for a set of endogenous metabolites and xenobiotics. The PIXiE-generated CCS values were within error of those calculated using commercially available instrument vendor software.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000442	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8XC7Q			Whole blood and serum 1D-1H-NMR metabolomics	Serum is a common sample of convenience for metabolomics studies. Its processing time can be lengthy and may result in the loss of metabolites including those of red blood cells (RBC). Unlike serum, whole blood (WB) can be quickly processed, minimizing the influence of hemolysis without excluding RBC metabolites. To determine differences between serum and WB metabolomes, both sample types, collected from healthy volunteers, were assayed by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. A total of 34 and 51 aqueous metabolites were quantified from serum and WB, respectively. Free hemoglobin (Hgb) levels in serum were measured and the correlation between Hgb and serum metabolites was determined. All metabolites detected in serum were detected at higher concentrations in WB with the exception of acetoacetate and propylene glycol. The 18 unique metabolites of WB included adenosine, AMP, ADP and ATP, which are associated with RBC metabolism. The use of serum results in the underrepresentation of a number of metabolic pathways including branched chain amino acid degradation and glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. The range of free Hgb in serum was 0.03-0.010 g/dL and 8 metabolites were associated (p < 0.05) with free Hgb. The range of free Hgb in serum samples from 18 sepsis patients was 0.02-0.46 g/dL. WB and serum have unique aqueous metabolite profiles but the use of serum may introduce potential pathway bias. Use of WB for metabolomics may be particularly important for studies in diseases like sepsis in which RBC metabolism is altered and mechanical and sepsis-induced hemolysis contributes to variance in the metabolome.

Essential oils (EOs) are part of the plants volatilome and consist of complex blends of hydrophobic metabolites. EOs are valuable for green chemistry applications. However, the interactions between the environment and plant processes controlling its chemical composition are poorly understood. The work aimed to provide a comprehensive characterization of the EOs from native species in distinct Atlantic Rainforest formations and access their antimicrobial potential. Aerial parts were harvested and dried for oil extraction by hydrodistillation, in two subsequent years. Chemical profiles were done by GC-MS and the metabolites identified by mass spectra and retention indices. Oil contents were determined by area normalization using GC–FID. Antimicrobial activity was investigated by in vitro growth inhibition. Computing and graphics were generated in R. The EO chemical profile was determined for plants from 50 species, in 15 botanical families, from nine Rainforest locations. Mono and sesquiterpenes were the most abundant chemical classes, followed by methyl ketones, phenylpropanoids and benzyl alcohols. Season and location were better discriminants for EO chemical profile than botanical family. Modules of co-regulated metabolites were identified and shown to correlate with environmental factors. Antimicrobial activity was widespread for the isolated EOs. Results provide a comprehensive metabolite profile of the EOs from the Atlantic Rainforest. Metabolite modules, correlated to environmental conditions, are conserved in complex plant populations. EOs are effective to inhibit pathogenic bacterial and fungal growth.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000444	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8NW2H			Metabolomics of Murine Age-related Deep Vein Thrombosis	Objective: Age is a significant risk factor for the development of venous thrombosis (VT), but the mechanism(s) that underlie this risk remain(s) undefined and poorly understood. Aging is known to adversely influence inflammation and affect metabolism. Untargeted metabolomics permits an agnostic assessment of the physiological landscape and lends insight into the mechanistic underpinnings of clinical phenotypes. The objective of this exploratory study was to test the feasibility of a metabolomics approach for identifying potential metabolic mechanisms of age-related VT. Methods: We subjected whole blood samples collected from young and old nonthrombosed controls and VT mice 2 days after thrombus induction using the electrolytic inferior vena cava, to a methanol:chloroform extraction and assayed the resulting aqueous fractions using 1D-1H- nuclear magnetic resonance. Normalized mouse metabolite data were compared across groups using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Holm-Sidak post-testing. In addition, associations between metabolite concentrations and parameters of thrombosis such as thrombus and vein wall weights, and markers of inflammation, vein wall P- and E-selectin levels, were assessed using linear regression. The relatedness of the found significant metabolites was visually assessed using a bioinformatics tool, Metscape, which generates compound-reaction-enzyme-gene networks to aid in the interpretation of metabolomics data. Results: Old mice with VT had a greater mean vein wall weight compared with young mice with VT (P < .05). Clot weight differences between old and young mice followed the same trend as vein wall weight (0.011 % 0.04 g vs 0.008 % 0.003 g; P [ not significant). Glutamine (ANOVA, P < .01), proline (ANOVA, P < .01), and phenylalanine (ANOVA, P <.05) levels were increased in old VT mice compared with age-matched controls and young VT mice. Betaine and/or trimethylamine N-oxide levels were increased in aged mice compared with young animals. Vein wall weight was strongly associated with glutamine (P < .05), and phenylalanine (P <.01) concentrations and there was a trend toward an association with proline (P [ .09) concentration. Vein wall Pselectin, but not E-selectin levels, were increased in old VT mice and were associated with the three found metabolites of age-related VT. Collectively, with the addition of glutamate, these metabolites form a single compound-reaction-enzyme gene network that was generated by Metscape. Conclusions: We used 1D-1H-nuclear magnetic resonance metabolite profiling to identify, for the first time, in an experimental model, three potential metabolites, glutamine, phenylalanine, and proline, associated with age-related VT. These metabolites are metabolically related and their levels are associated with vein wall weight and P-selectin concentrations. In aggregate, these findings provide a “roadmap” of pathways that could be interrogated in future studies, which could include provocation of the glutamine, phenylalanine, and proline pathways in the vein wall. This study introduces metabolomics as a new approach to furthering knowledge about the mechanisms of age-related VT.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000445	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8J60X			Comparing identified and statistically significant lipids and polar metabolites in 15-year old serum and dried blood spot samples for longitudinal studies	The use of dried blood spots (DBS) has many advantages over traditional plasma and serum samples such as the smaller blood volume required, storage at room temperature, and ability to sample in remote locations. However, understanding the robustness of different analytes in DBS samples is essential, especially in older samples collected for longitudinal studies. Here we analyzed the stability of polar metabolites and lipids in DBS samples collected in 2000-2001 and stored at room temperature. The identified and statistically significant molecules were then compared to matched serum samples stored at –80°C to determine if the DBS samples could be effectively used in a longitudinal study following metabolic disease. A total of 400 polar metabolites and lipids were identified in the serum and DBS samples using gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), liquid chromatography (LC)/MS, and LC/ion mobility spectrometry-MS (LC/IMS-MS). The identified polar metabolites overlapped well between the sample types, though only one statistically significant metabolite was conserved in a case-control study of older diabetic males with low amounts of high-density lipoproteins and high body mass indices, triacylglycerides and glucose levels when compared to non-diabetic patients with normal levels, indicating that degradation in the DBS samples affects polar metabolite quantitation. Differences in the lipid identifications indicated that some oxidation occurs in the DBS samples. However, 36 statistically significant lipids correlated in both sample types. The difference in the number of statistically significant polar metabolites and lipids indicated that the lipids did not degrade to as great of a degree as the polar metabolites in the DBS samples and lipid quantitation was still possible.

These compounds were identified through a high throughput screening designed for that purpose. During that screening, we screened 43,783 compounds and identified 367 primary hits. These 367 hits were further retested using a 8-point dilution series (from 0.25 to 30 uM) and verified the activity of 250 compounds that induce the hyper lipid accumulating phenotype in algae. Once the hit compounds were identified and confirmed, we then performed extensive chemoinformatics analysis to look for common scaffolds and identified several common substructures. We then selected 15 top performing compounds from 5 diverse structural groups and tested biochemical parameters such as growth, lipid accumulating capacity, effect on photosynthetic rates, respiration rates, oxygen consumption rates, analysis of different lipid species to quantify and identify fatty acid species using GC-MS. To understand the global changes in the metabolome, 2 structurally different compounds were selected and compared with cells grown without compounds as control for untargeted metabolomics analysis.

We recently discovered a novel role of abnormal cellular intermediary metabolism in hypertension in the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat, the most commonly used polygenic, hereditary model of human salt-sensitive hypertension. We propose to test the hypothesis that blood pressure sensitivity to dietary salt intake in human is associated with metabolite changes in the urine. Leveraging the expertise and resources at the Mayo Clinic Metabolomics Resources Core, we propose to perform targeted LC/MS analysis and NMR spectra generation in urine samples obtained from a subset of subjects from the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension – Sodium (DASH2) clinical trial and kidney tissue extract and urine samples from SS rats and a newly generated transgenic rat that overexpresses fumarase (SS.Fh1+). The study will be the first to systematically characterize urinary metabolite profiles associated with blood pressure response to salt in humans. The study is anticipated to generate new insight into the mechanisms (particularly renal mechanisms) underlying salt-sensitive hypertension. Findings of the proposed study could lead to an expanded clinical study as well as mechanistic studies in animal models.

It remains unclear why some populations develop diabetes at higher rates than others and whether prevention and treatment strategies should also differ. The main goal of the current study is to determine the impact of body composition and physical activity on biomarkers for insulin resistance in American Indian adolescents. We propose to use a targeted metabolomic approach to measure amino compounds and fatty acids in plasma. We will address these goals by exploring two Specific Aims: 1. To determine the effects of obesity and physical activity on circulating biomarkers for diabetes and metabolic disease risk in American Indian youth. Plasma samples used for measurements of amino compounds and fatty acids will be acquired from boys and girls 11-21 years old classified as, a) obese, low habitual physical activity and low fitness; b) normal weight, low habitual physical activity and low fitness; or, c) normal weight, high habitual physical activity and high fitness. 2. To determine the impact of exercise training on circulating biomarkers for diabetes and metabolic disease risk in obese American Indian youth. The same obese group tested in the cross-sectional comparison in Aim 1 will complete 16 weeks of aerobic exercise training. Plasma samples acquired before and after training will be used to measure amino compounds and fatty acids. The results of this project will provide novel information about the metabolic changes associated with insulin resistance, obesity, and physical activity in young people who are at risk for, but have not yet developed cardiometabolic disease. The study design takes advantage of, and supports the scientific partnership among investigators at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, and Mayo Clinic Rochester. This will set the stage for future lifestyle intervention studies to further explore the concepts outlined in this proposal.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000459	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8QP56			Role of the Serine Biosynthesis Pathway in Supporting the Warburg Effect of Pancreatic Cancer Cells	Pancreatic cancer cells metabolize glucose differently than normal adult cells, relying on aerobic glycolysis even in oxygen-rich environments. This phenomenon, known as the Warburg effect, is the basis of PET scans for tumor imaging and diagnosis, but a definitive explanation for how this benefits cancer cells has remained elusive, and altered cell metabolism has not been fully exploited for therapeutic benefit. The Warburg effect is accompanied by expression of the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PK); while many differentiated normal cells express PKM1, proliferating cells, including all cancer cells, express PKM1. We have generated both normal cell lines and pancreatic cancer cell lines that can be genetically controlled to express either PKM1 or PKM2. While normal proliferating cells stop proliferating when forced to express PKM1 rather than PKM2, pancreatic cancer cells proliferate just as rapidly with forced PKM1 expression. Preliminary data shows that pancreatic cancer cells upregulate the serine biosynthesis pathway during forced PKM1 expression. To probe the role of the serine biosynthesis pathway in supporting cancer proliferation in the context of isoform-specific PK expression, we have targeted genes in the serine biosynthesis pathway using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and generated pancreatic cancer knockout cell lines. The proposed research will use isotope-labeled precursors and genetic engineering to identify the metabolic dependencies of pancreatic cancer cells. Genetically engineered pancreatic cancer cell lines cultured with 13C-glucose, 13C-glutamine, or 13C-serine will be extracted and sent to the Mayo Clinic Metabolomics Resource Core for isotopic enrichment analysis of various amino acids, TCA cycle metabolites, fatty acids, and sphingolipids. This work will provide crucial first insight for altered metabolism of pancreatic cancer cells that can lead to novel metabolic targets for effectively treating pancreatic cancer.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000460	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8M027			The dystrophic muscle metabolome: effects of exercise and NO donor therapy	In Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD, BMD), loss of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin weakens the sarcolemma and disrupts cellular signaling, rendering the diseased muscles susceptible to contractioninduced damage. We and others have shown that loss of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSµ) from the sarcolemma of dystrophin-deficient muscle causes functional muscle ischemia during exercise due to unopposed sympathetic vasoconstriction, thereby exacerbating fatigue and injury of the diseased muscles. Genetic and pharmacologic strategies targeting nNOSµ-NO signaling ameliorate functional muscle ischemia, as well as many other features of the dystrophic phenotype in the mdx mouse model of DMD/BMD. These findings suggest that the therapeutic benefit of NO likely extends beyond its vascular effects. A growing body of evidence indicates that NO directly influences muscle metabolism through effects on glucose transport as well as mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Both nNOS-/- mice and mdx mice exhibit muscle mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased resistance to fatigue, and exercise-induced muscle injury, suggesting a causal role of nNOSµ-NO deficiency. However, the specific metabolic changes resulting from reduced NO signaling that might render dystrophic muscle susceptible to fatigue and use-dependent injury remain poorly defined. Therefore, the goal of this pilot metabolomics study is to identify the unique biochemical profiles of skeletal and cardiac muscles of mdx mice to gain further mechanistic insight into the pathophysiological role of NO deficiency in muscular dystrophy. In Aim 1, we will characterize the skeletal and cardiac muscle metabolomes of mdx and nNOS-/- mice at rest and following a single bout of treadmill exercise with the goal of discovering common metabolic signatures caused by loss of NO signaling. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the potential of a NO donor drug that is under development as a therapeutic for DMD/BMD to improve the skeletal and cardiac muscle metabolomes in mdx mice. As a result of this pilot study, we hope to gain new understanding of the metabolic derangements in dystrophin-deficient muscle, insight into the therapeutic effects of NO replacement, and to identify new pathogenic mechanisms and putative therapeutic targets that will form the basis of future grant applications.

This work builds on our previous study showing that soybean oil, rich in polyunsaturated fats, is more obesogenic and diabetogenic than coconut oil, rich in saturated fats (PMID: 26200659). Here, in order to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for soybean oil induced obesity, we have performed the first ever metabolomics (in plasma and liver) and proteomics on the livers of mice fed the two soybean oil diets (plus those fed a high coconut oil and Viv chow diet). Our results show that the new high oleic soybean oil induces less obesity and adiposity than conventional soybean oil, but can cause hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction. Metabolomic analysis reveals that the hepatic and plasma metabolic profiles differ considerably between the two soybean oils. Hepatic C18 oxylipin metabolites of omega-6 (?6) and omega-3 (?3) fatty acids (linoleic and a-linolenic acid, respectively) in the cytochrome P450/soluble epoxide hydrolase pathway were found to correlate positively with obesity.

The mainstay of treatment to improve lower limb symptoms is supervised walking therapy, which does not affect plaque morphology or alter conduit artery blood flow, but rather ameliorates endothelial dysfunction, enhances skeletal muscle metabolism and mitochondrial function, and suppresses inflammatory activation. In this pilot feasibility project we will employ metabolic and lipidomic techniques to measure the effects of supervised exercise therapy on primary metabolism, complex lipids, and lipid mediators, and correlate these effects with individual, subject-level measures of the response to exercise therapy among subjects with PAD. The overarching theme of this work is to identify metabolites, complex lipids, and lipid mediators that are associated with the inter-individual variability in the response of subjects with PAD to supervised exercise therapy. This knowledge will significantly enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of lower extremity symptoms in PAD, as well as the manner in which supervised exercise therapy improves walking intolerance. It will identify novel therapeutic targets and pathways for pharmacologic manipulation in the treatment of PAD. Aside from having the potential to generate multiple high-impact publications, it will serve as the basis for a planned NIH R01 submission by the PI at the conclusion of the award period.

With marked antioxidant, anti-inflammation and anti-tumor activities, Camellia nitidissima Chi has been used as an effective treatment of cancer. The azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) induced CRC mice model was established and the prevention effect of Camellia nitidissima Chi extracts on the evolving of CRC was evaluated by gross examination, histopathological inspection, serum biochemistry analysis, combined with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics and correlation network analysis. The results showed that Camellia nitidissima Chi extracts could significantly inhibit AOM/DSS induced CRC, relieve the colonic pathology and ameliorate the serum biochemistry, and could signi?cantly reverse the disturbed metabolism towards the normal state. Moreover, the butanol fraction showed a better efficiency than the water-soluble fraction of Camellia nitidissima Chi. The study pave the way for further development of Camellia nitidissima Chi extracts as a potent CRC inhibitor.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000571	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8VM2M			Pharmacometabolomics of L-Carnitine Treatment for Septic Shock	Rationale: Sepsis therapeutics have a poor history of success in clinical trials, due in part to the heterogeneity of enrolled patients. Pharmacometabolomics could differentiate drug response phenotypes and permit a precision medicine approach to sepsis. Objective: To utilize existing serum samples from the phase I clinical trial of L-carnitine treatment for severe sepsis to metabolically phenotype L-carnitine responders and non-responders. Methods: Serum samples collected prior to (T0) and after completion of the infusion (T24, T48) from patients randomized to either L-carnitine (12 g) or placebo for the treatment of vasopressor dependent septic shock were assayed by untargeted 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics. The normalized, quantified metabolite data sets of L-carnitine and placebo treated patients at each time point were compared by ANOVA with post-hoc testing for multiple comparisons. Pathway analysis was performed to statistically rank metabolic networks. Measurements and main results: 38 metabolites were identified in all samples. Concentrations of 3-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, 3-hydroxyisovalerate were different at T0 and over time in L-carnitine treated survivors versus non-survivors. Pathway analysis of pre-treatment metabolites revealed that synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies had the greatest impact in differentiating L-carnitine treatment response. Analysis of all patients based on pre-treatment 3-hydroxybutyrate concentration yielded distinct phenotypes. Using the T0 median 3-hydroxybutyrate level (153µM), patients were categorized as either high or low ketone. L-carnitine treated low ketone patients had greater utilization of carnitine as evidenced by lower post-treatment L-carnitine levels. The L-carnitine responders also had faster resolution of vasopressor requirement and a trend towards a greater improvement in mortality at 1 year (p = 0.038) compared with patients with higher 3-hydroxybutyrate. Conclusions: The results of this preliminary study, that were not readily apparent from the parent clinical trial, show a unique metabolite profile of L-carnitine responders and introduce pharmacometabolomics as a viable strategy for informing L-carnitine responsiveness. The approach taken in this study represents a concrete example for the application of precision medicine to sepsis therapeutics that warrants further study.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000574	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8GD58			Mayo Pilot and Feasibility: Identifying metabolic adaptations characteristic of multiple myeloma cells via mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling	Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell malignancy that remains incurable in most afflicted patients. It can be preceded by an asymptomatic, premalignant stage known as smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) that does not require therapy but has an increased life-long risk of progression to MM. However, one-third of SMM patients are “high risk” for imminent progression to MM within two years of diagnosis compared to the remainder of SMM patients who continue on an indolent asymptomatic course for several years. The diagnosis of MM cannot be made until they experience overt end-organ damage such as renal failure, lytic bone destruction, anemia and hypercalcemia. Currently, we lack sensitive biomarkers that can identify all SMM patients at high risk of progression to MM. Being able to identify high risk SMM patients could allow us to initiate systemic chemotherapy before they progress to MM. Cancer cells undergo distinct metabolic adaptations to meet the augmented cellular demand for energy and nutrients created by their increased rates of cellular proliferation. The presence of an altered cellular metabolism in clonal PCs from MM patients and its role as an essential factor in the progression of SMM to MM is unknown. We hypothesize that the clonal PCs in high risk SMM patients likely have an altered metabolic phenotype similar to those present in MM patients but different when compared to clonal PCs in the remainder of the SMM patients whose clinical course remains indolent. Thus, two specific aims are proposed in this study: Aim 1 will verify if there are differences in the regulation of the metabolic pathways in clonal PCs from MM patients compared to normal PCs from healthy patients; Aim 2 will assess whether the clonal PCs from high risk SMM patients bear a distinct metabolic phenotype compared to clonal PCs from standard risk SMM patients.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000575	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8BM2Z			Mayo Pilot and Feasibility: Targeting Myelin Metabolism to Enhance Recovery of Function after SCI	The loss of myelin, degeneration of the myelin producing oligodendroglia and impaired remyelination are essential features of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) that significantly limit patient recovery of function. The lipid rich composition of myelin, including exceptionally high levels of saturated fatty acids, underlie its essential physiological roles, including its structural and signaling properties and electrical insulation of axons to facilitate the conduction of nerve impulses. The myelin sheaths also provide metabolic support to the axons they wrap, and myelin health is therefore essential to the maintenance of axon integrity and function in the brain and spinal cord. The primary goal of this Pilot Proposal to the Mayo Clinic Metabolomics Core is to integrate highly sensitive metabolomics liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) assays to quantify the lipid composition of the myelin membrane, with our conventional neurobehavioral approaches, enabling us to explore the metabolic basis of new interventions capable of promoting myelin regeneration and restoration of patient function. Metabolomics Core expertise in Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) based evaluation of key metabolites involved in CNS injury and repair (N-acetyl-L-aspartate, choline, myo-inositol, glucose/ glutamine and lactate) will also be applied to strengthen our mechanistic understanding of myelin injury and repair. Specifically, utilizing these innovative approaches we will test a novel hypothesis driven by new preliminary findings that the levels of dietary fatty acids can be optimized alone, or in combination with exercise training, to facilitate myelin regeneration and recovery of neurobehavioral function after injury to the adult spinal cord. In Aim 1, we will determine whether alterations in dietary fat, including saturated fat or omega-3 fatty acids, facilitate restoration of the myelin membrane and metabolite signatures of central nervous system repair after experimental SCI in adult mice. In Aim 2, we will determine whether exercise training alone or in combination with dietary fatty acid supplementation fosters myelin regeneration and recovery of function after experimental SCI. The proposed studies will leverage the expertise of the Mayo Metabolomics Core with that of Dr. Scarisbrick (Mayo) in myelin biology and Dr. Gomez Pinilla (UCLA) in central nervous system plasticity to investigate whether two highly targetable lifestyle variables, that is diet and exercise, can be modulated to improve myelin metabolism and functional recovery after SCI.

The Zeki lab is investigating the role of the mevalonate (MA) pathway, in the pathogenesis of airway inflammation and remodeling. Although statins all inhibit HMGCR in the same manner in terms of enzyme binding site, the statins’ varied physiochemical properties with respect to their polarity (i.e. lipophilicity) result in very different immune and lipid effects. The major significance of this work is to advance a new class of inhaler therapies for asthma; the statins which work by an entirely different mechanism than current ICS/LABA mainstays. Evidence suggests that statins may have an additive benefit to corticosteroids in asthma, thereby confirming a unique mechanism, namely via MVA pathway inhibition. This becomes particularly important in the severe asthma population which is highly corticosteroid-resistant, is poorly controlled with high exacerbation rates and hospitalizations, and has the highest healthcare costs of all asthma phenotypes. In essence, the potential public health impact of even an incremental improvement in asthma symptom control cannot be underestimated. Even the prevention of 1 asthma attack preserves lung function and reduces the adverse personal and financial impact. This study aimed to determine if statin polarity affects airway drug concentration and systemic drug absorption and to determine the effect of inhaled statins on naïve airway immune cell populations and alveolar-capillary membrane and epithelial barrier integrity in healthy rhesus monkeys. In this particular component of the study, we investigated the metabolic effects resulting from the use of statins in these healthy rhesus monkeys. Specifically, the Newman lab analyzed for lipid mediator (oxylipin, endocannabinoid, fatty acid, and nitro lipid) in lung and trachea tissue, plasma, and BAL and bile acid changes in the lung and trachea tissue and plasma.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000602	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8VH5Q			Biomarkers discovery for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)	Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer. Current diagnosis of HCC relies on the measurement of the level of the serum biomarker, a-fetoprotein (AFP). However, the sensitivity and specificity of AFP are not sufficient for diagnosis of HCC as elevated AFP levels may be seen in patients with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis too. Therefore, reliable serological biomarkers for early detection of HCC in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients are yet to be found and validated. Metabolomics provides simultaneous assessment of a broad range of metabolites that can potentially serve as indicators of the overall physiology status as well as the response to host and environmental stimuli. It has been broadly used for biomarker discovery and characterization of complex diseases such as cancer.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000603	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8QQ3S			Causal genetic variation underlying metabolome differences	A goal of biology is to predict the phenotypes of individuals, such as side effects to drugs, from their genotypes. Genetic variants that cause disease can change an individual’s total metabolite profile, or metabolome. Understanding the function of these genetic variants may help predict novel phenotypes. We used an unbiased method in yeast to show that genetic differences in two genes change the levels of several urea cycle metabolites. Leveraging knowledge of the urea cycle, we then predicted and validated the sensitivity of yeast strains to a particular drug. The interpretability of our results demonstrates the promise of using genetic variants underlying differences in the metabolome to predict novel phenotypes from genotype.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000604	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8M09W			Maternal Hypoxemia and oxidative stress in the fetus, newborn, and adult.	Gestational hypoxia presents a significant stress to an unborn fetus that can lead to significant complications related to fetal growth restriction and resulting in diseases in the newborn as well as those manifesting later in life. Recent evidence indicates that inflammation and oxidative stress are contributing factors to hypoxia-related diseases. The Center for Perinatal Biology at Loma Linda University has studied gestational chronic hypoxia in a sheep model for over 20 years to study dysfunction of vascular and nonvascular tissues derived from mothers, fetuses and offspring. In this project we are attempting to use metabolomics to assess metabolic dysregulation in vascular tissues along with markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in the mother and offspring to determine the extent of dysregulation due to chronic hypoxia. Untargeted metabolomics analysis focused on sheep plasma and arteries from the lung, resistance arteries in the brain, uterine arteries, and cultured human myocytes will be used to explore markers of glucose and lipid metabolism disruption. Targeted analyses of oxylipins and endocannabinoids will be used on the same samples to explore markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, which should be increased during hypoxia. This study should delineate pathways and biomarkers that help explain how hypoxia leads to the development of neonatal as well as adult-onset diseases associated with chronic hypoxia that are inter-related with fetal growth restriction.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000606	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M82D92			Metabolomic investigations on Nesterenkonia flava from different origins revealed significant intraspecies differences between marine and terrestrial actinomycetes	Marine is one of the most important resources of microorganisms, including bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi. As marine and terrestrial environments differ a lot in many aspects it is not surprising that the species and characteristics of microorganisms living there are very different. Interestingly, many marine microorganisms can find their congeners of the same species from terrestrial resources. The aim of this work is to evaluate the intraspecies differences between marine and terrestrial actinomycetes on metabolic level and to uncover the mechanism responsible for the differences. To address this, we carried out comparative metabolomics study on Nesterenkonia flava strains isolated from marine and terrestrial environments. The results showed that marine strains were clearly distinguished from their terrestrial congeners on the principal components analysis (PCA) scores plot of intracellular metabolites. The markers responsible for the discrimination of marine and terrestrial strains were figured out using loading plot from partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA). Pathway analysis based on PLS-DA, univariate analysis, and correlation analysis of metabolites showed that the major differential metabolites between the terrestrial N. flava and the marine ones were involved in osmotic regulation, redox balancing, and energy metabolism. Together, these insights provide clues as to how the previous living environment of microbes affect their current metabolic performances under laboratory cultivation conditions.

However, few studies have examined the short and long-term impact of these risk factors on neurodevelopmental outcomes in children in low-income countries, where the effects are likely to be more pronounced due to limited resources for monitoring and insufficient regulations. Biological risk factors of relevance include micronutrient deficiencies such as zinc and exposure to heavy metals such as lead and mercury. Studies have suggested an association between neurodevelopmental impairment and micronutrient deficiency as well as exposure to a number of heavy metals and environmental toxins. Moreover, findings also suggest that risk factors for adverse developmental outcomes that are independently significant may have the potential for causing cumulative increases in adverse effects. In Sub-Saharan Africa, severe malaria is a leading risk factor for long-term neurocognitive impairment in children. Zinc deficiency or exposure to heavy metals could influence risk of severe malaria, modify the risk of neurocognitive impairment in children with severe malaria, or independently affect risk of neurocognitive impairment. Untargeted analyses for potential environmental exposures or metabolomic changes in children with cerebral malaria vs. without cognitive impairment or in children with higher vs. lower cognitive scores, could also identify new risk factors for neurodevelopmental impairment in Ugandan children with cerebral malaria.In our completed study in Kampala, we assessed neurologic and developmental impairment in children with cerebral malaria [CM] or severe malarial anemia [SMA], as compared to health community children from the same extended household as the children with CM or SMA. As an extension of this study, we are interested in determining levels of micronutrients such as zinc in the population, and in addition, determining exposure levels of heavy metals (lead, mercury, copper, manganese etc.) in samples collected from children with severe malaria and community controls. The primary hypotheses of this study is that nutrient deficiencies or exposure to heavy metals influence short and long term neurocognitive outcomes in healthy community children and in children with severe malaria, and that children with cerebral malaria have specific metabolomic changes that relate to long-term neurocognitive impairment. The specific aims of our study are:Aim 1: To determine levels of zinc, heavy metals, and biomarkers associated with inflammation in children presenting with different forms of severe malaria (SM) and in healthy community children (CC). The working hypothesis of this aim is that 1) children with SM will have lower zinc levels compared to CC; 2) children with SM will present with higher toxic metal exposure and higher levels of biomarkers associated with inflammation than CC.Aim 2: To investigate how micronutrient deficiency, toxic metal exposure and inflammatory biomarkers affect short and long term neurodevelopmental outcomes and growth in children with severe malaria and community children (CC).The working hypothesis of this aim is that the lower levels of zinc, and presence of toxic metals in high concentrations will independently contribute to worsening neurodevelopmental outcomes and worsening growth over time in children with severe malaria and in community children. An alternate hypothesis is that micronutrient deficiency, toxic metal exposure and inflammatory states may interact with each other and with severe malaria to produce greater neurodevelopmental impairment, i.e., that the contribution is not independent but interactive.Aim 3: To determine whether the CSF metabolome differs according to level of neurodevelopmental impairment in children with cerebral malaria. The working hypothesis of this aim is that neurodevelopmental impairment in children with cerebral malaria is associated with changes in the CSF metabolome.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000609	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8Z679			Fatty Acid Oxidation is Impaired in An Orthologous Mouse Model of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease	Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD; MIM ID's 173900, 601313, 613095) is estimated to affect almost 1/1000 and is the most common genetic cause of end stage renal disease (Torres et al., 2007). While advances have been made in slowing the progression of some other forms of chronic kidney disease, standard treatments have not reduced the need for renal replacement therapy in ADPKD (Spithoven et al., 2014). Unfortunately, several experimental interventions also have recently failed to show significant benefit in slowing the rate of functional decline (Serra et al., 2010; Walz et al., 2010; Schrier et al., 2014; Torres et al., 2014), and the only positive study reported very modest effects (Torres et al., 2012). These findings suggest new treatment strategies are required. A central dogma of molecular genetics is that discovery of the causative genes will lead to identification of key pathways and potential targets for intervention. In the case of ADPKD, the two genes mutated in the disorder, PKD1 and PKD2, were identified almost 20 years ago and yet their functions remain poorly understood. The PKD1 gene product, polycystin-1 (PC1), encodes a large membrane protein that requires the PKD2 gene product, polycystin-2 (PC2), for its trafficking to the primary cilium where the two are thought to form a receptor channel complex (Kim et al., 2014; Cai et al., 2014). What the complex senses and what it signals remains controversial. The primary cilium has emerged as a key player in the pathogenesis of PKD as mutations in dozens of different genes that encode either essential ciliary components or factors in ciliary signaling pathways result in PKD. A recent report suggests that the relationship between the polycystin complex and ciliary signaling is complicated, however.While ablation of primary cilia by mutation of core ciliary components results in cysts, these same perturbations done in the setting of Pkd1 or Pkd2 inactivation results in significant attenuation of cystic disease (Ma et al., 2013). These data suggest that the polycystin complex provides a suppressive signal for a novel, cilia-dependent growth-promoting pathway that is independent of MAPK/ERK, mTOR, or cAMP pathways, three effector pathways previously implicated as major drivers of cyst growth. The identities of the growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting pathways remain unknown. We have taken a systems-based approach to study Pkd1 gene function. Building on our previous work identifying markedly different outcomes in animals with induced Pkd1 inactivation before or after P12 and correlating this susceptibility with metabolic status (Piontek et al., 2007; Menezes et al., 2012), we now show that female sex is partially protective in adult-induced Pkd1 inactivation, that sex differences in metabolic status may account for this effect, and that cells lacking Pkd1 have abnormal fatty acid oxidation. Finally, manipulating diet in Pkd1 mouse models, we demonstrate a positive correlation between lipid content in mouse chow and cystic kidney disease severity. Our results therefore suggest that abnormal lipid metabolism is an intrinsic component of PKD and an important modifier of disease progression.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000610	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8TH6S			Diet, genetics and gut microbiome drive dynamic changes in plasma metabolites	Diet, genetics and the gut microbiome are determinants of metabolic status, in part through production of metabolites by gut microbiota. To understand mechanisms linking these factors, we performed LC-MS-based metabolomic analysis of cecal contents and plasma from C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ and 129S6/SvEvTac mice on chow, high-fat diet (HFD), and HFD-treated with vancomycin or metronidazole. Prediction of the functional metagenome of gut bacteria by PICRUSt analysis of 16S sequences revealed dramatic differences in microbial metabolism. Cecal and plasma metabolites showed multifold differences reflecting the combined and integrated effects of diet, antibiotics, host background, and the gut microbiome. Eighteen plasma metabolites correlated positively or negatively with host insulin resistance across strains and diets. Over 1,000 as-of-yet-unidentified metabolite peaks were also highly regulated by diet, antibiotics and genetic background. Thus diet, host genetics and gut microbiota interact to create unique responses in plasma metabolites, which can contribute to regulation of metabolism and insulin resistance. 
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000611	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8XQ41			Metabolomics analysis of leprosy patients with type 1 reaction	Type 1 reaction (T1R) is an acute inflammatory episode that causes severe neuronal damages in patients with leprosy. The factors that trigger this pathology is still unknown, and further studies are needed to understand T1R and to early prevent its start. It is well established that the host immune response is linked to T1R and previous studies indicated that the metabolism of the host also influences the adaptive immune response against M. leprae antigens. Therefore, metabolomics-based analyses of sera from 7 patients with and 9 without T1R were conducted via liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. The main goal of this project was to determine whether the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (such as eicosanoids and omega-3 fatty acids) were perturbed in leprosy patients with T1R.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000612	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8FM7S			Breathprinting Reveals Malaria-Associated Biomarkers and Mosquito Attractants	Current evidence suggests that malaria infection could alter patient breath metabolites, a phenomenon that could be exploited to create a breath-based diagnostic test. Indications include the preferential attraction of the Anopheles mosquito vector upon infection and a distinct breath profile with the progression of experimental, sub-microscopic malaria. However, these observations have yet to be extended to the clinic. To investigate whether natural human malaria infection leads to a characteristic breath profile, we performed a field study in Malawi. Breath volatiles from pediatric patients with and without uncomplicated falciparum malaria were analyzed by thermal desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Using an unbiased, correlation-based analysis, we find that children with malaria have a distinct shift in overall breath composition. Leveraging these differences, highly accurate classification of infection status was achieved with a suite of six compounds. In addition, we find that malaria-infected children have significantly higher breath levels of two mosquito-attractant terpenes, a-pinene and 3-carene. Thus, our work attests to the viability of breath analysis for malaria diagnosis, identifies candidate compounds for follow-up studies, and identifies biologically plausible chemical mediators for increased mosquito attraction to malaria-infected patients.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000613	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8F681			Evidence that COG0325 proteins are involved in Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) homeostasis	Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is an essential cofactor for nearly 60 Escherichia coli enzymes but is a highly reactive molecule that is toxic in its free form. How PLP levels are regulated and how PLP is delivered to target enzymes are still open questions. The COG0325 protein family belongs to the fold-type III class of PLP enzymes and binds PLP but has no known biochemical activity although it occurs in all kingdoms of life. Various pleiotropic phenotypes of the E. coli COG0325 (yggS) mutant have been reported, some of which were reproduced and extended in this study. Comparative genomic, genetic and metabolic analyses suggest that these phenotypes reflect an imbalance in PLP homeostasis. The E. coli yggS mutant accumulates the PLP precursor pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) and is sensitive to an excess of pyridoxine but not of pyridoxal. The pyridoxine toxicity phenotype is complemented by the expression of eukaryotic yggS orthologs. It is also suppressed by the presence of amino acids, specifically isoleucine, threonine and leucine, suggesting the PLP-dependent enzyme transaminase B (IlvE) is affected. These genetic results lay a foundation for future biochemical studies of the role of COG0325 proteins in PLP homeostasis.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000614	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8KD9Q			Gut Microbiota Modulate Brain Insulin Sensitivity and Neurobehavior	Obesity and diabetes in humans are associated with increased rates of anxiety and depression. To understand the role of the gut microbiome and brain insulin resistance in these disorders, we evaluated behaviors and insulin action in brain of mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) with and without antibiotic treatment. We find that DIO mice have behaviors reflective of increased anxiety and depression. This is associated with decreased insulin signaling and increased inflammation in multiple brain regions. Treatment with oral metronidazole or vancomycin decreases inflammation, improves insulin signaling in the brain and reduces signs of anxiety and depression. These effects are transferable to germ-free mice by fecal transplant of gut microbiota and are associated with changes in the levels of tryptophan, GABA, BDNF, amino acids and multiple acylcarnitines in the brain. Thus, changes in gut microbiota can control brain insulin signaling and metabolite levels, and this leads to altered neurobehaviors.

Non-targeted metabolomic profiling was performed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) optimized for basic or acidic species and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC/UPLC-MS/MS).
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000626	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8RH5S			Evidence that the metabolite repair enzyme NAD(P)HX epimerase has a moonlighting function	Damaging enzymatic and chemical side-reactions in all organisms convert NADH and NADPH to their hydrates, NADHX and NADPHX, which exist as R and S epimers [1,2]. The hydrates, which inhibit various dehydrogenases [3,4], are reconverted to NAD(P)H by the sequential actions of NADP-(H)X epimerase (EC 5.1.99.6) and NAD(P)HX dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.93) [5-7] (Figure 1A). Both enzymes occur in all domains of life [5]. The dehydratase is specific for the S form of NAD(P)HX [1] and the epimerase facilitates conversion of the R form to the S form used by the dehydratase [5-7]. Over time, if not reconverted to NAD(P)H, the R and S forms of NAD(P)HX give rise spontaneously to cyclic forms of NAD(P)HX, which are not substrates for the epimerase or the dehydratase [1,5] (Figure 1A). Together, the formation and removal of NAD(P)HX constitute an archetypal example of metabolite damage and repair [8-10]. The functions of the epimerase and the dehydratase are supported by biochemical evidence from mammals, yeast, Escherichia coli, and plants [5-7], and that of the dehydratase is also supported by genetic and metabolomic evidence from Arabidopsis [6]. The in-vivo function of the NAD(P)HX dehydratase protein seems to match its in-vitro enzymatic activity [6], but the situation for the epimerase protein may be more complex, as several discordant ob3 servations suggest. First, as NAD(P)HX epimers equilibrate spontaneously and quite rapidly (t½ = 40 min) in physiological conditions, it is not entirely clear why epimerase activity is needed [1]. Second, while the epimerase is fused to the dehydratase in most prokaryotes, it is fused in plants to pyridoxine/pyridoxamine phosphate oxidase (PPOX), a salvage enzyme for vitamin B6, i.e. pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and related compounds [5-7,11,12]. Since protein fusions imply functional relationshipsbetween the partners [13,14], the PPOX fusion points to a B6 connection, in plants at least. Third, and relatedly, epimerase and dehydratase expression are not correlated in Arabidopsis [7]. Fourth, the mammalian epimerase (NAXE) occurs in extracellular compartments (cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and the plasma of septic patients) [15], which the dehydratase does not – although both enzymes occur in the mitochondria and cytosol [16]. Moreover, NAXE can bind apolipoprotein A-1, a plasma protein that is a major component of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) complex [15]. This binding is proposed to link NAXE to cholesterol transport, atherosclerosis, and angiogenesis [17,18]. To summarize the above, there are reasons to suspect that NAD(P)HX epimerase is more than just an epimerase, and that it has a moonlighting function [19] related to B6. This suspicion has become medically relevant with the discovery that nonsense or missense mutations in the human epimerasegene NAXE (also called AIBP) lead to a neurodegenerative disease that is lethal in infancy [20, 21]. The etiology of this disease – and potential therapies – have so far been conceived solely in terms of loss of NAD(P)HX epimerase activity [20,21]. While the NAXE protein deficiency and cyclic NADHX accumulation observed in fibroblasts from affected individuals [21] are consistent with lack of epimeraseactivity causing the symptoms, they do not prove that this is the case. Nor is it evident why intracellular buildup of NADHX to the reported level of ~5 pmol/mg protein [21], equivalent to ~1 µM [22], would have such a severe impact in humans given that a similar accumulation in Arabidopsis had no discernable consequences [6] and that 1 µM NADHX corresponds to only ~1% of the NADH pool in typical mammalian cells [23]. These considerations led us to use comparative genomic and genetic approaches to explore the possibility that NAD(P)HX epimerase has a moonlighting function. Our results build a strong circumstantial case that such a function exists, and that it involves B6 metabolism.

The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from IDH mutation impairs histone demethylation and results in a block to cell differentiation by Lu and colleagues, published in Nature in 2012 (Lu et al., 2012). The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 1B, 2A, 2B, 2D and 4D. Lu and colleagues demonstrated that expression of mutant forms of IDH1 or IDH2 caused global increases in histone methylation and increased levels of 2 hydroxyglutarate (Figure 1B). This was correlated with a block in differentiation (Figures 2A, B and D). This effect appeared to be mediated by the histone demethylase KDM4C (Figure 4D). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Scienceand Science Exchange, and the results of the replications will be published by eLife.

To better understand how vitamin A status influences gut microbiota and host metabolism, we systematically analyzed urine, cecum, serum, and liver samples from vitamin A sufficient (A+) and A- mice using 1H NMR-based metabolomics, quantitative (q)PCR, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing coupled with multivariate data analysis. The microbiota in the cecum of A- mice showed compositional as well as functional shifts compared to the microbiota from A+ mice. Targeted 1H NMR analyses revealed significant changes in microbial metabolite concentrations including higher butyrate and hippurate and decreased acetate and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate in A+ relative to A- mice. Bacterial butyrate-producing genes including butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase and butyrate kinase were significantly higher in bacteria from A+ versus bacteria from A- mice. A - mice had disturbances in multiple metabolic pathways including alterations in energy metabolism (hyperglycemia, glycogenesis, TCA cycle, and lipoprotein biosynthesis) and the A- host showed metabolites indicative of a hypermetabolic state (higher levels of amino acids and nucleic acids). A- mice had hyperglycemia, liver dysfunction, changes in bacterial metabolism, and altered gut microbial communities. Moreover, integrative analyses indicated a strong correlation between gut microbiota and host energy metabolism pathways in the liver. Vitamin A regulates the microbiota, bacterial metabolism and the effects of vitamin A on the microbiota results in alterations to host metabolism.

Specific Aim 1 will examine the adverse impact of environmental chemicals in fasting blood samples measured by HRM on obesity (i.e., total body fat and body mass index (BMI)), metabolic dysfunction (e.g., fasting glucose and insulin concentrations and insulin resistance), and obesity-induced inflammation (i.e., leptin) among 104 Southern California adolescents enrolled in the CHS. Specific Aim 2 will examine associations of childhood exposures to PM2.5 and traffic-related air pollutants (i.e., CALINE model-predicted NOx) with biological metabolites identified in fasting blood samples using HRM among 104 adolescents in the CHS. Specific Aim 3 will investigate the metabolic pathways linking air pollution exposures and obesity and type 2 diabetes-related traits using pathway analysis under bayesian hierarchical model among 104 adolescents in the CHS.

Focusing on the pathogenesis of central nervous system abnormalities in ME/CFS, we pursued metabolomics analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 32 ME/CFS cases, 40 subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS), another fatiguing illness, and 19 healthy subjects with no neurological disease (ND). MS/ND subjects were frequency matched for age and sex to ME/CFS subjects. Three untargeted metabolomic assays for primary metabolites, biogenic amines and complex lipids were performed with gas chromatography time-of-flight (GC-TOF) and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) yielding profiles for 525 known metabolites. Mannose was a cardinal biomarker in ME/CFS subjects with reduced levels in ME/CFS compared to both MS and ND subjects. Levels of acetylcarnitine were reduced in ME/CFS vs. MS subjects. The predictive power of metabolomic analysis for diagnosis of ME/CFS vs. ND was higher (cross-validated AUC 0.875; 95% CI: 0.726~0.949) than with cytokine analysis alone (cross-validated AUC 0.865; 95% CI: 0.673~0.952) and improved with integration of both metabolomics and cytokine analyses (cross-validated AUC 0.916; 95% CI: 0.791~0.969). Our findings confirm the biological basis of ME/CFS, and may enable new methods for diagnosis and insight into cognitive and autonomic disturbances in this syndrome.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000632	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8038Z			Metabolomic adaptation of a deep sea Microbacterium sediminis to prolonged low temperature under high pressure	Low temperature is the most wide-spread “hostile” environmental factor on earth while at the same time the most common condition for marine organisms. However, the unique adaptive mechanisms that enable the survival of marine microorganisms under low temperature are unclear. Since low temperature is always accompanied by high pressure and other adverse conditions in marine environment, here we studied the metabolic adaptation of a marine strain to prolonged low temperature under high pressure. The strain studied is a psychrotolerant Microbacterium sediminis isolated from deep sea sediment. By using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics approach, we detected the spectral data of polar extracts of the strain M. sediminis, and applied multivariate statistical analysis methods together with univariate analysis to analyze metabolic profiles associated to different conditions. The metabolic profiles of the M. sediminis strain cultivated under high pressure at low temperature were distinctly different from those cultivated under high pressure at normal temperature. We identified the differential metabolites which were responsible for distinguishing the metabolic profiles and compared their relative intensities between groups. We also compared the different adaptive responses of the strain at different growth stages to the prolonged low temperature under high pressure. We proposed that the low-temperature adapting process of the M. sediminis strain involves, 1) the regulation of osmotic pressure using amino acids as possible alternative osmolytes, and, 2) the strengthen of glycolysis and the maintenance of TCA cycle via amino acids anaplerotic reaction. We put forward that the main difference of adaptation to low temperature for the strain at different growth stages was related to energy metabolism. Our findings improved the understanding of the low-temperature adaptive mechanisms for marine microorganisms under high pressure on the metabolic level.

Recognition and timely diagnosis of these different stages, particularly NASH, is important for both potential reversibility and limitation of complications. Liver biopsy remains the clinical standard for definitive diagnosis. Diagnostic tools minimizing the need for invasive procedures or that add information to histologic data are important in novel management strategies for the growing epidemic of NAFLD. We describe an 'omics' approach to detecting a reproducible signature of lipid metabolites, aqueous intracellular metabolites, SNPs, and mRNA transcripts in a double-blinded study of patients with different stages of NAFLD that involves profiling liver biopsies, plasma, and urine samples. Using linear discriminant analysis, a panel of 20 plasma metabolites that includes glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, sterols, and various aqueous small molecular weight components involved in cellular metabolic pathways, can be used to differentiate between NASH and steatosis. This identification of differential biomolecular signatures has the potential to improve clinical diagnosis and facilitate therapeutic intervention of NAFLD.

Biomarkers offer the potential to objectively identify injury status, severity, and phenotype by measuring the relative concentrations of endogenous molecules in readily accessible biofluids. Through a data-driven, discovery approach, novel biomarker candidates for TBI were identified in the serum lipidome of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats in the first week following moderate controlled cortical impact (CCI). Serum samples were analyzed in positive and negative ion modes by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS). A predictive panel for the classification of injured and uninjured sera samples, consisting of 26 dysregulated species belonging to a variety of lipid classes, was developed with a cross-validated accuracy of 85.3% using omniClassifier software to optimize feature selection,. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and PUFA-containing diacylglycerols were found to be upregulated in sera from injured rats, while changes in sphingolipids and other membrane phospholipids were also observed, many of which map to known secondary injury pathways. Overall, the identified biomarker panel offers viable molecular candidates representing lipids that may readily cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and aid in the understanding of TBI pathophysiology.

Glucocorticoids (GC) are the primary therapy, but are ineffective in ~20% of children and ~50% of adult cases. Patients with steroid resistant NS (SRNS) fail to enter remission after prolonged oral GC treatment, and are at high risk for GC-induced side effects and progression to end-stage kidney disease. This study aimed to discover markers of steroid resistance that could be potentially used to predict SRNS at presentation, and develop an improved mechanistic definition of pediatric SRNS. Plasma samples were collected from 30 steroid sensitive NS (SSNS) and 15 SRNS patients, and paired samples analyzed which were collected both at disease presentation, prior to any steroid therapy, and after ~7 weeks of daily GC treatment. Broad spectrum 1HNMR data were acquired, binned, and concentration fit. Multivariate analyses and hypothesis testing were used to determine the metabolites that best differentiated the four phenotypic groups. Treatment effects on metabolomics profiles were observed between paired Pre- and Post- treatment SSNS groups, and between Post SSNS and SRNS groups. Metabolites most perturbed by GC treatment included lipoproteins , adipate, pyruvate, alanine, creatine, glucose, tyrosine, valine, and glutamine. Logistic regression using a stepwise variable selection method was used on Pre- samples to model the odds at clinical presentation of SRNS. After controlling for age, the step-wise logistic regression model selected increased glutamine (OR= 1.01; 0.99-1.02 95% CI) as a marker of SRNS. A similar model with children age >3 only, indicated that children with reduced levels of malonate (OR=0.94; 0.89-1.00 95% CI) had an increased odds of SRNS . Thus, malonate concentration may be a potential plasma biomarker for identifying SRNS at initial clinical presentation.

Little is known about the exact mechanisms of insulin resistance in PCOS and how metformin can improve insulin sensitivity, increase the frequency of ovulation and lower androgens in PCOS. Preliminary data from metabolomic analyses of amino acids demonstrate increased concentrations of lysine and its metabolite, a-aminoadipic acid (AAA), in PCOS versus obese controls. Interestingly, greater AAA concentrations predicted the development of type 2 diabetes in the Framingham epidemiologic cohort, experimentally lowers glucose in animal models and increases insulin secretion in vitro. To date, the mechanism for increased circulating concentrations of lysine and AAA in insulin-resistant individuals is not known. Building upon these findings, we have initiated a project to simultaneously study lysine and AAA kinetics for the first time in insulin-resistant individuals using stable isotope tracer methodology. We will evaluate: 1) whether lysine and AAA kinetics are altered in PCOS versus healthy controls; 2) the effect of hyperinsulinemia on lysine and AAA kinetics in PCOS versus controls; 3) whether treatment to improve insulin sensitivity changes lysine and AAA kinetics in PCOS. The long-term goal is to target pathways for the treatment of PCOS and the prevention of type 2 diabetes in PCOS and other insulin-resistant individuals at greater risk for type 2 diabetes.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000655	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M80X1K			Explore Metabolites and Pathways Associated Increased Airway Hyperresponsiveness in Asthma	Asthma is a heterogeneous disease largely defined by chronic airway inflammation with similar symptomatology in patients that includes wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough. However, underlying these common symptoms are varying endotypes with distinct pathophysiological processes. Metabolomic studies in patients with asthma are emerging and suggest that metabolomics can characterize distinct asthma phenotypes. In a completed study, we identified a population of patients with asthma who have increased airway hyperresponsiveness (airway hyperresponsiveness is a marker for asthma disease severity) who are characterized by race (African American) and genotype (ADRB2 Arg16/Arg) compared with patients who have less airway hyperresponsiveness (African Americans and whites with differing ADRB2 genotypes). This group may represent a distinct endotype of asthma with unique metabolomic and lipidomic characteristics. The aims of this project are to (1) use metabolomic and lipidomic analysis to identify metabolites present in plasma in this population of patients with asthma who have increased airway hyperresponsiveness (African Americans who carry the ADRB2 Arg16/Arg genotype) and patients with asthma who have less airway hyperresponsiveness (African Americans and whites with differing ADRB2 genotypes); and (2) identify pathways that will improve the understanding of increased airway hyperresponsiveness in this population. We hypothesize that there will be unique metabolic pathways in the population with increased airway hyperresponsiveness that will be distinct from pathways in patients with lower airway hyperresponsiveness. In this project will use data and samples that were previously collected as part of the NIH funded project “Pharmacogenetics of ß2-Agonists in Asthma” (Blake, PI K23 HL081245). Blood was collected in 55 African Americans and whites after receiving 2-weeks treatment with inhaled fluticasone. Samples were stored on ice until processed and plasma frozen at -80°C. If our findings indicate distinct metabolic pathways are present using global metabolomic and lipodomic analysis, we will seek to replicate our findings using samples and data from phenotypically well characterized participants who participated in trials conducted through the American Lung Association Airways Clinical Research Centers network, of which Nemours has been a highly productive site since 1999. Future controlled trials would be conducted to evaluate treatments based upon molecular pathways identified through metabolomic and lipidomic analysis.

This microbe-CRC connection suggests a potential paradigm shift in the way CRC is detected, treated and managed. Knowledge of specific microbial components involved in the development of CRC is critical to moving this field forward. Among the bacterial species known to associate with CRC, Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Sg), previously known as S. bovis biotype I, stands out as having a strong and well-documented clinical association supported by numerous case reports and surveys over the past several decades. We and others also found that Sg is present in a substantial percentage of CRC patients (up to ~ 74%). We further demonstrated that Sg actively promotes colon tumor growth. These exciting discoveries underscore the importance of Sg in CRC with respect to both function and clinical relevance. Further investigation into the molecular details of the Sg-CRC relationship should have a high priority. Going forward, the key question is how Sg promotes colon tumor development. Data from our lab led us to hypothesize that Sg produces certain metabolites that contribute to its ability to promote cell proliferation. We propose to identify the metabolites important for promoting colon cancer cell proliferation. Our approach is based on two recent findings. We discovered that there are variations among Sg strains in the ability to stimulate host cell proliferation. We also observed that the ability of Sg to promote cell proliferation is bacterial growth phase regulated. Thus by comparing the metabolomics profiles of different Sg strains, and Sg strains from different growth phase co-cultured with colon cancer cells, respectively, we will identify metabolomics signatures that correlate with the ability of Sg to promote cell proliferation. These metabolites will then be investigated in more detail in future studies. In addition, DNA methylation pattern in cells treated with Sg, negative control bacteria and media only will also be compared.

The goal of this proposal is to investigate how human milk impacts the infant gut microbiome during the first 12-months of life and identify the microbe-host interactions that mediates the protective role of breastfeeding on infant adiposity. The results of this exploratory study will characterize factors that influence microbial transmission between mothers and offspring and identify human milk compounds that stabilize a healthy infant microbiome with potential to reduce pediatric obesity.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000659	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8GX0J			Mayo Pilot and Feasibility: The Influence of Sugar, Artificial Sweeteners, and the Microbiome on Metabolism	As diabetes becomes a growing heath concern, afflicting nearly 25.8 million people in the United States and nearly 220 million people worldwide, there has been an increased awareness of environmental factors like diet that are contributing to the disease. In diabetic patients, a major causal factor contributing to progression of the disease is hyperglycemia, although the underlying mechanisms by which hyperglycemia impairs homeostatic processes are not well understood. While we know that early intensive glycemic control reduces the risk of cardiovascular complications in humans and rodent models, there is a large gap in studies of the etiology of hyperglycemia-induced alterations in the disease. To combat high sugar diets that could contribute to diabetes and subsequent hyperglycemia, non-caloric artificial sweeteners have become one of the most utilized food additives worldwide due to their consideration as a low caloric substitute. However, supporting scientific data as to the safety of these non-caloric artificial sweeteners is limited and controversial. The negative implications of consuming a high sugar diet on overall health have long been linked to diabetes, obesity, and resulting systemic health problems; however, it was not until recently that the negative impact of consuming artificial sweeteners in the place of sugar had been increasingly recognized. Recent evidence also suggests that a diet rich in artificial sweeteners can induce glucose intolerance through the alteration of the gut microbiome. We hypothesize that a specific subset of plasma metabolites are generated as a result from a diet rich in commonly used artificial sweeteners and their subsequent processing by the gut microbiome, which could ultimately lead to impaired glycemic control and negative physiological health outcomes. To test this hypothesis this study will 1) administer a diet high in glucose, fructose, and 4 common artificial sweeteners separately to rats followed by a plasma metabolic analysis (AIM 1) and 2) treat the gut microbiota with antibiotics in these animals to observe how alterations of the microbiome influence the plasma metabolic profile in animals receiving the altered diets (AIM 2). The resulting data will give us insights into the influence of high sugar and artificial sweetener diets on homeostatic metabolic processes and dive into the symbiotic relationship of the gut microbiome with this process. This data will provide crucial insights into the dietary use of artificial sweeteners in the replacement of sugars and how it alters metabolic pathways that could potentially lead to altered states of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

As a result, RGCs die after acute injury and in progressive degenerative diseases such as glaucoma; such damage can lead to permanent vision loss and blindness. Little is known about the roles of lipids in axon injury and repair despite their fundamental importance in composition of cell membranes, myelin sheaths and mediation of signaling pathways. Study of the lipidome in the biology of optic nerve (ON) regeneration has been largely neglected. A better understanding of the roles that lipids play in RGC biology may enhance understanding of RGC-related diseases and point to novel treatments. Established experimental models of ON regeneration allow exploration of molecular determinants of RGC axon regenerative success and failure. In this study, we used high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to analyze lipidomic profiles of the ON and retina in an ON crush model with and without intravitreal Zymosan injections to enhance regeneration. Our results reveal profound remodeling of retina and ON lipidomes that occur after injury. In the retina, Zymosan treatment largely abrogates widespread lipidome alterations. In the ON, Zymosan induces lipid profiles that are distinct from those observed in naïve and vehicle-injected crush controls. We have identified a number of lipid species, classes and fatty acids that may be involved in the mechanisms of axon damage and repair. Lipids upregulated during RGC regeneration may be interesting candidates for further functional studies.

Here, we performed comprehensive in vivo quantitative proteomic profiling of pancreatic islets from adolescent and old mice. Nutrient tracing and targeted metabolomics demonstrated accelerated accumulation of glucose-derived metabolites and coupling factors in aged islets, indicating that age-related changes in glucose metabolism contribute to improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with age. Together, our study provides the first in-depth characterization of age-related changes in the islet proteome and establishes metabolic rewiring as an important mechanism for age-associated changes in ß-cell function.

We hypothesize that thiamine metabolites alleviate bottlenecks in the TCA cycle and gluconeogensis, thus allowing for greater starch production when they are present. Cells were grown in bioreactors: 3 control cultures with no thiamine metabolites, 3 cultures received thiamine, 3 recieved HMP, and 3 were grown on residual medium from another algae species - Chlorella sorokiniana. We suspect that this residual medium also contains thiamine metabolites. Samples were taken daily from each of these 12 cultures over a 5 day time course so that we can observe build-up of metabolites over time.

Methods: We used serum samples from a non-human primate (NHP), a baboon (Papio hamadryas), with suitable quality controls to quantify the chemical space using an advanced HR MS platform for confident metabolite identification and robust quantification to assess the suitability of the platform for routine clinical metabolomics research. In a comparative approach, we also analyzed the same serum samples using a two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass-spectrometer (2D GC-ToF-MS) for metabolite identification and quantification following established standard protocols. Results: Overall, the 2D GC-ToF-MS and GC-Orbitrap-MS analyses enabled identification and quantification of 555 total metabolites from the NHP serum with a spectral similarity score Rsim = 900 and S/R ratio of > 25. A common set of 30 metabolites with HMDB and KEGG IDs were quantified in the serum samples by both platforms where the 2D GC-ToF-MS enabled quantification of a total 384 metabolites (118 HMDB IDs) and the GC-Orbitrap-MS analysis quantification of a total 200 metabolites (47 HMDB IDs). Conclusions: Our study provides insights into the benefits and limitations of the use of a higher mass accuracy instrument for untargeted GC-MS-based metabolomics with multi-dimensional chromatography in future studies addressing clinical conditions or exposome studies.

Within the GC6-74 cohorts, 4,462 HIV-negative healthy household contacts of 1,098 index TB cases were recruited from 2006 to 2012 at four African sites included in this study i.e. SUN (Stellenbosch University, South Africa), MRC (Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia), AHRI (Armauer Hansen Research Institute, Ethiopia) and MAK (Makerere University, Uganda). The study had an exclusion period of 3 months, such that participants, who were diagnosed with active TB within 3 months of enrolment, were excluded from analysis to prevent inclusion of participants who had incipient or asymptomatic clinical TB disease at enrolment. Additional exclusion criteria were positive HIV rapid test, current or previous anti-retroviral treatment, history of TB, pregnancy, participation in drug and/or vaccine clinical trials and chronic disease diagnosis or immunosuppressive therapy within the past 6 months, and living in the study area for less than 3 months. A total of 97 individuals who developed active TB within the two year follow-up period were included in this study and matched at a ratio of 1:4 with participants who remained healthy during the 2-year follow-up period (controls); matching, by site, age class, sex, and wherever possible year of recruitment. Initial samples collected upon enrolment were termed baseline (BL) samples. Further samples were taken 6 and 18 months post-exposure, provided that the participant had remained TB free at the time of sample collection. Metabolic profiling was carried out for each study site, using either serum or plasma samples. For a small number of samples, an insufficient amount of plasma was available, so the sample was diluted using RPMI buffer.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000667	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8FX07			Identification of unique metabolite networks between Latino and Caucasian patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of liver pathology ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); the latter is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis. Risk factors for NALFD include obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension—all of which are features of metabolic syndrome. NAFLD is a very heterogeneous disease, as it presents in different patterns in males and females and in patients from different ethnicities, with unclear predictors for development and severity of disease. Previous studies have shown that NAFLD is 1.4 times more frequent in Hispanics than in Caucasians. One of the major challenges in NAFLD is the lack of accurate, noninvasive biomarkers for the detection of the most aggressive presentation, NASH. The gold standard for the diagnosis is liver biopsy, which is an invasive procedure associated with possible complications. Noninvasive diagnosis of NASH is a major unmet medical need and there are no ethnicity-specific biomarkers that can diagnose this condition and predict its progression. Therefore, the main gap in knowledge that this proposal and line of research will address is the characterizing the different plasma and liver metabolomics profile of patients with fatty liver from two ethnicities (Latinos vs. Caucasians) and of both sexes. The overall hypothesis of the present study is that the higher incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) in Latino patients is reflected in a different plasma and liver metabolomics profile compared to Caucasian patients with further sex-related differences. Characterization of metabolite networks can aid in identifying the mechanistic underpinnings of sex and ethnic driven differences in NAFL which could help diagnose and establish a prognosis of this condition, especially in the critical transition from NAFL to the more aggressive nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).To address this hypothesis, plasma metabolomics profile of samples from male and female Latino and Caucasian bariatric surgery patients with NAFL and from healthy subjects will be compared. Metabolomics findings will be related with liver pathology and liver transcriptome profiles from intraoperatively obtained liver biopsies using correlation, network, and pathway analysis.

Co-administration of synbiotics is associated with decreased AAGS in people, potentially due to stabilization of the fecal microbiome and metabolome. The purpose of this double-blinded randomized-controlled trial was to compare AAGS and the fecal microbiome and metabolome between healthy cats that received clindamycin with a placebo or synbiotic. Methods. 16 healthy domestic shorthair cats from a research colony were randomized to receive 150 mg clindamycin with either a placebo (8 cats) or commercially-available synbiotic (8 cats) once daily for 21 days with reevaluation 603 days thereafter. All cats ate the same diet. Food consumption, vomiting, and fecal score were recorded. Fecal samples were collected daily on the last 3 days of baseline (days 5-7), treatment (26-28), and recovery (631-633). Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed. Clinical signs, alpha and beta diversity metrics, dysbiosis indices, proportions of bacteria groups, and metabolite profiles were compared between treatment groups using repeated measures ANOVAs. Fecal metabolite pathway analysis was performed. P<0.05 was considered significant. The Benjamini & Hochberg’s False Discovery Rate was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Results. Median age was 6 and 5 years, respectively, for cats in the placebo and synbiotic groups. Hyporexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or some combination therein were induced in all cats. Though vomiting was less in cats receiving a synbiotic, the difference was not statistically significant. Bacterial diversity decreased significantly on days 26-28 in both treatment groups. Decreases in Actinobacteria (Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, Slackia), Bacteriodetes (Bacteroides), Lachnospiraceae (Blautia, Coprococcus, Roseburia), Ruminococcaceae (Faecilobacterium, Ruminococcus), and Erysipelotrichaceae (Bulleidia, [Eubacterium]) and increases in Clostridiaceae (Clostridium) and Proteobacteria (Aeromonadales, Enterobacteriaceae) occurred in both treatment groups, with incomplete normalization by days 631-633. Derangements in short-chain fatty acid, bile acid, indole, sphingolipid, benzoic acid, cinnaminic acid, and polyamine profiles also occurred, some of which persisted through the terminal sampling timepoint and differed between treatment groups. Discussion. Cats administered clindamycin commonly develop AAGS, as well as short- and long-term dysbiosis and alterations in fecal metabolites. Despite a lack of differences in clinical signs between treatment groups, significant differences in their fecal metabolomic profiles were identified. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether antibiotic-induced dysbiosis is associated with an increased risk of future AAGS or metabolic diseases in cats and whether synbiotic administration ameliorates this risk.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000672	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8T68F			Validating Quantitative Untargeted Lipidomics Across Nine Liquid Chromatography?High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry Platforms	Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods are most often used for untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics. However, methods have not been standardized as accepted “best practice” documents, and reports lack harmonization with respect to quantitative data that enable interstudy comparisons. Researchers use a wide variety of high-resolution mass spectrometers under different operating conditions, and it is unclear if results would yield different biological conclusions depending on the instrument performance. To this end, we used 126 identical human plasma samples and 29 quality control samples from a nutritional intervention study. We investigated lipidomic data acquisitions across nine different MS instruments (1 single TOF, 1 Q/orbital ion trap, and 7 QTOF instruments). Sample preparations, chromatography conditions, and data processing methods were kept identical. Single-point internal standard calibrations were used to estimate absolute concentrations for 307 unique lipids identified by accurate mass, MS/MS spectral match, and retention times. Quantitative results were highly comparable between the LC-MS platforms tested. Using partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to compare results between platforms, a 92% overlap for the most discriminating lipids based on variable importance in projection (VIP) scores was achieved for all lipids that were detected by at least two instrument platforms. Importantly, even the relative positions of individual samples on the PLS-DA projections were identical. The key for success in harmonizing results was to avoid ion saturation by carefully evaluating linear dynamic ranges using serial dilutions and adjusting the resuspension volume and/or injection volume before running actual study samples.

Therefore, in this proposal, we will test the central hypothesis that increased pathologic enterohepatic circulation of enteric metabolites which trigger specific pro-fibroinflammatory hepatobiliary responses are centrally involved in the etiopathogenesis of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). While these processes have been hypothesized to play a significant role in the initiation, progression, and adverse clinical sequelae of PSC, they have not been directly tested to date. In our proposal, we will experimentally address the nature and extent of the metabolomic profiles of portal and peripheral blood as well as bile in patients with PSC. We will perform qualitative and quantitative ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy-based metabolomic analyses to determine metabolic changes in portal and peripheral plasma and bile. Through subsequent pathway analyses we intend to identify metabolic enzymes and known biochemical pathways that may be altered in PSC. We anticipate that patients with PSC will have distinct alterations in the portal venous and bile metabolomic profiles and associated signaling pathways compared to normal and disease controls; and these alterations may be amenable to pharmacologic manipulation and future therapies.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000676	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8968S			Natural genetic variation in C. elegans identified genomic loci controlling metabolite levels	Metabolic homeostasis is sustained by complex biological networks that respond to nutrient availability. Genetic and environmental factors may disrupt this equilibrium leading to metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. To identify the genetic factors controlling metabolism, we performed quantitative genetic analysis using a population of 199 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We focused on the genomic regions that control metabolite levels by measuring fatty acid (FA) and amino acid (AA) composition in the RILs using targeted metabolomics. The genetically diverse RILs showed a large variation in their FA and AA levels with a heritability ranging from 32-82%. We detected strongly co-correlated metabolite clusters and 36 significant metabolite QTL (mQTL). We focused on mQTL displaying highly significant linkage and heritability, including an mQTL for the FA C14:1 on Chromosome I, and another mQTL for the FA C18:2 on Chromosome IV. Using introgression lines (ILs) we were able to narrow down both mQTL to a 1.4 Mbp and a 3.6 Mbp region, respectively. RNAi-based screening focusing on the Chromosome I mQTL identified several candidate genes for the C14:1 mQTL, including lagr-1, Y87G2A.2, nhr-265, nhr-276, and nhr-81. Overall, this systems approach provides us with a powerful platform to study the genetic basis of C. elegans metabolism. Furthermore, it allows us to investigate interventions, such as nutrients and stresses that maintain or disturb the regulatory network controlling metabolic homeostasis, and identify gene-by-environment interactions.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000677	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85H44			Gut microbiome structure and metabolic activity in inflammatory bowel disease	The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which include Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are multifactorial, chronic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. While IBD has been associated with dramatic changes in the gut microbiota, changes in the gut metabolome -- the molecular interface between host and microbiota -- are less-well understood. To address this gap, we performed untargeted LC-MS metabolomic and shotgun metagenomic profiling of cross-sectional stool samples from discovery (n=155) and validation (n=65) cohorts of CD, UC, and non-IBD control subjects. Metabolomic and metagenomic profiles were broadly correlated with fecal calprotectin levels (a measure of gut inflammation). Across >8,000 measured metabolite features, we identified chemicals and chemical classes that were differentially abundant (DA) in IBD, including enrichments for sphingolipids and bile acids, and depletions for triacylglycerols and tetrapyrroles. While >50% of DA metabolite features were uncharacterized, many could be assigned putative roles through metabolomic “guilt-by-association” (covariation with known metabolites). DA species and functions from the metagenomic profiles reflected adaptation to oxidative stress in the IBD gut, and were individually consistent with previous findings. Integrating these data, however, we identified 122 robust associations between DA species and well-characterized DA metabolites, indicating possible mechanistic relationships that are perturbed in IBD. Finally, we found that metabolome- and metagenome-based classifiers of IBD status were highly accurate and, like the vast majority of individual trends, generalized well to the independent validation cohort. Our findings thus provide an improved understanding of perturbations of the microbiome-metabolome interface in IBD, including identification of many potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000678	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M81Q26			Mayo Pilot and Feasibility: A pilot study of urine metabolomics towards an outpatient estimate of circadian phase	Although the effectiveness of several therapeutic interventions depend critically on their timing with respect to circadian phase, including the timing of light therapy for circadian rhythm sleep disorders, medications for high blood pressure, and chemotherapy treatments for cancer, no clinical test is available to reliably measure circadian phase rapidly, inexpensively, and non-invasively. This project will therefore provide the essential first steps toward the development and validation of a clinical test to estimate circadian phase from a single urine void via the identification of multiple rhythmic metabolites in urine using untargeted metabolomic profiling methods. Current methods to assess circadian phase in urine require serial measurement of a single compound (e.g., 6-sulphatoxymelatonin, the urinary metabolite of melatonin) over a 24- to 48-hour sampling window. Our approach proposes to assess many compounds in one sample to estimate circadian phase, based on the phase relationships across multiple parameters, an approach that is supported by our theoretical modeling framework. Using the untargeted metabolomics profiling services offered by the Mayo Clinic Metabolomics Resource Core, we will examine the 48-hour profiles of ~300 metabolites identified from urine samples collected in a randomly selected pilot sample of 12 healthy young volunteers (from >200 subjects) studied on an inpatient laboratory protocol that included both an ambulatory condition (i.e., habitual sleep-wake times under ordinary room light) and a constant routine procedure, the gold standard method for assessing circadian rhythms (i.e., 50-hour period during which subjects remain awake in a semi-recumbent posture in bed under dim light with equicaloric snacks served hourly). Cosinor analysis will be employed to determine which identified metabolites exhibit circadian rhythmicity, and comparisons between ambulatory and constantroutine conditions will further identify which metabolites are influenced by external factors such as sleep, meal timing, light, and posture. Finally, we will employ our theoretical modeling framework to estimate circadian phase from a single urine void using the concentration ratios of multiple metabolites that exhibit reliable and robust circadian rhythmicity. The accuracy of estimated circadian phase will be determined by comparison to actual circadian phase as defined by the peak of the 6-sulphatoxymelatonin rhythm. Once this approach has been established in a pilot set of subjects, future studies will focus on validation and testing of this approach in other data from our repository, including healthy young volunteers who have undergone rapid phase shift due to changes in sleep-wake schedule (i.e., simulated shift work) or in response to bright light exposure; patients with insomnia, who exhibit an 8-hour range in circadian phase; and blind participants without light perception, who exhibit non-entrained rhythms. Future studies will also test the efficacy of this method to a priori estimate circadian phase in patient populations that may benefit from improvements in circadian timing of treatment. The current proposal therefore represents the first essential step in developing a tool that can revolutionize medicine by adding an accurate measure of internal time – circadian medicine – into standard clinical practice.

The goal of this project is to investigate the interactions between relevant environmental exposures and asthma severity in a year-long longitudinal study of urban children with asthma. Environmental and clinical samples are being collected at 3 seasonal visits. Using these samples, we will measure the effects of multiple relevant exposures (environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalates, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)) on biological responses (metabolomics, oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and endocannabinoids) and asthma outcomes. Our overall hypothesis is that relevant environmental exposures and their interactions drive disease severity in urban children with asthma. We will test this hypothesis by investigating the following aims: Aim 1: To investigate how environmental exposures (ETS, PAHs, phthalates, and VOCs) and their interactions contribute to asthma severity in urban children. Aim 2: To determine if environmental exposures in children with asthma are associated with changes in in biological responses (metabolomics, oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and endocannabinoids). Aim 3: To determine which biological responses mediate the relationships between environmental exposures and asthma severity. Aim 4: To compare environmental exposures and biological responses in asthmatic and non-asthmatic children
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000680	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8S684			Mayo Pilot and Feasibility: Metabolomics of Muscle Wasting in Cancer Cachexia	Cachexia is a debilitating syndrome that results in severe, involuntary weight loss due to the depletion of skeletal muscle mass. This syndrome occurs in a majority of cancers and contributes to approximately one third of all cancer deaths. Currently, no effective therapy exists to combat this malignant disorder, and disappointing results from recent Phase III clinical trials indicate that a cachexia treatment is not likely to appear soon. Thus, it is clear that greater knowledge of the mechanisms driving muscle wasting in cachexia is needed in order to identify new therapeutic targets and stimulate new clinical trials. Our approach to gaining this knowledge has been to work with muscle biopsies from pancreatic cancer patients, since this population is highly prone to cachexia. We have also been expanding our studies beyond the classical mouse models of cancer cachexia in hopes of finding a new model that better recapitulates the human disease. We recently undertook RNA-Seq analysis comparing muscle biopsies from pancreatic cancer patients with and without cachexia, which has been exciting since this type of analysis has not yet been performed in patient samples. Preliminary results revealed that cachectic muscle was associated with alterations in metabolism. These data provide the rationale for performing metabolomics to ascertain whether specific metabolic pathways or metabolites can be identified as potential drivers of muscle wasting in cachexia or be used as biomarker of cachexia, which the field desperately needs. An additional need is a well-validated animal model of cancer cachexia that accurately reflects the human condition, which can be used to test mechanisms and pre-clinical compounds. We propose to perform these studies under the Mayo Clinic Metabolomics Resource Core Pilot and Feasibility Grant program to: 1) Identify metabolic alterations and biomarkers of pancreatic cancer-induced muscle wasting; and 2) Identify a suitable mouse model that recapitulates the metabolic imbalance of muscles from pancreatic cancer cachexia patients. By performing these studies, we will accelerate our understanding of the underlying causes of muscle wasting, which should translate to improving the current pipeline of anticachexia therapies.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000681	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8NH4G			Multi-Platform Physiologic and Metabolic Phenotyping Reveals Microbial Toxicity	The gut microbiota are susceptible to modulation by environmental stimuli and therefore can serve as biological sensors. Recent evidence suggests that xenobiotics can disrupt the interaction between the microbiota and host. Here, we describe an approach that combines in vitro microbial incubation (isolated cecal contents from mice), flow cytometry, and mass spectrometry- and 1H NMR-based metabolomics to evaluate xenobiotic-induced microbial toxicity. Tempol, a stabilized free radical scavenger known to remodel the microbial community structure and function in vivo, was studied to assess its direct effects on the gut microbiota. Microbiota were isolated from mouse cecum and were exposed to tempol for 4 h under strict anaerobic condition. The flow cytometry data suggested short term exposure of the microbiota to tempol is associated with disrupted membrane physiology as well as compromised metabolic activity. Mass spectrometry and NMR metabolomics revealed that tempol exposure significantly disrupted microbial metabolic activity, specifically indicated by changes in short chain fatty acids, branched chain amino acids, amino acids, nucleotides, glucose, and oligosaccharides. In addition, a mouse study with tempol (5 days gavage) showed similar microbial physiologic and metabolic changes, indicating the in vitro approach reflected in vivo conditions. Our results, through evaluation of microbial viability, physiology and metabolism, and comparison of in vitro and in vivo exposures with tempol, suggests that physiologic and metabolic phenotyping provides unique insight into gut microbiota toxicity.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000683	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8D11B			Mayo Pilot and Feasibility: Characterization of metabolomics profile changes during development of post-traumatic epilepsy	According to the report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2014, traumatic brain injury (TBI) accounts for 30% of all injury-related deaths in the U.S. Developing epilepsy after severe head injury is as high as 40%-50% in some settings. Importantly, many TBI victims develop epilepsy months or years following the initial injury. However, it has not been fully identified how to predict who will develop epilepsy and/or the underlying mechanism of post traumatic epilesy (PTE) development. The main goal of this proposal is to identify the metabolomics biomarker of TBI-induced epilepsy and to investigate the underlying mechanism of the transition from TBI to PTE. To do so, we will develop PTE using two TBI animal models: ferrous chloride injection model and cortical undercut model. Once the brain damage is made, electroencephalogram (EEG) and video monitoring will be performed to determine the onset point of epilepsy. Then, metabolomics profile changes will be analyzed and compared before and after PTE development.

It is thus critical to identify new approaches for therapy. Among pediatric patients, one of the most devastating brain tumor types is Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas (DIPG). Our understanding of this deadly disease has recently been advanced by important discoveries, including the discovery that the majority of DIPG tumors harbor the histone H3K27M mutation. This mutation results in global hypomethylation of H3K27 residues and is the pathological hallmark for this disease. Glutamine (Gln) addiction has been reported in many cancers including malignant adult gliomas. Glutamine likely promotes cancer cell proliferation and survival likely through generation of the TCA cycle intermediate alpha-ketoglutarate (a-KG). Importantly, a-KG is a critical co-factor for histone lysine demethylases including JMJD3, the enzyme responsible for removing the methyl groups from H3K27me3. Our preliminary data shows H3K27M tumor cells require Gln for survival, and if Gln is removed from the culture media, cells can be rescued by the addition of a-KG. Furthermore, Gln deprivation leads to an increase in H3K27 trimethylation similar to direct inhibition of JMJD3. It is for these reasons we hypothesize that H3K27M tumors are dependent on Gln derived a-KG both for feeding the TCA cycle and for further decreasing H3K27 trimethylation. Inhibition of Gln metabolism will likely uncover novel therapeutic targets for this deadly disease. In Aim 1 we will study Gln and glucose metabolism in H3K27M tumor cells and compare this to Wild Type (WT) tumors and Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs). In Aim 2 we will validate the therapeutic validity of inhibiting Gln metabolism in H3K27M tumors.

While the diverse biological roles of lipids contribute to their clinical utility, the unavailability of lipid internal standards representing each species, make lipid quantitation analytically challenging. The common approach is to employ one or more internal standards for each lipid class examined and use a single point calibration for normalization (relative quantitation). To aid in standardizing and automating this relative quantitation process, we developed LipidMatch Normalizer (LMN) http://secim.ufl.edu/secim-tools/ which can be used in most open source lipidomics workflows. While the effect of lipid structure on relative quantitation has been investigated, applying LMN we show that data-processing can significantly affect lipid semi-quantitative amounts. Polarity and adduct choice had the greatest effect on normalized levels; when calculated using positive versus negative ion mode data, one fourth of lipids had greater than 50 % difference in normalized levels. Based on our study, sodium adducts should not be used for statistics when sodium is not added intentionally to the system, as lipid levels calculated using sodium adducts did not correlate with lipid levels calculated using any other adduct. Relative quantification using smoothing versus not smoothing, and peak area versus peak height, showed minimal differences, except when using peak area for overlapping isomers which were difficult to deconvolute. By characterizing sources or variation introduced during data-processing and introducing automated tools, this work helps increase through-put and improve data-quality for determining relative changes across groups.

The software uses a trained neural network model to extract molecular features. As model for validation, we performed MS profiling of single identified cells from early developing embryos of the South African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) using a custom-built capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization platform coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The MS dataset from these measurements was manually curated for molecular features, and the resulting list of molecular features were used to test the robustness and accuracy of Trace at predicting molecular features that were detected from the single cells.

The active antimalarial OSM-S-313, and the inactive analogue OSM-S-291, were incubated with trophozoite stage P. falciparum parasites for five hours alongside reference compounds including atovaquone (ATV), chloroquine (CQ), dihydroartemisisin (DHA) and three PfATP4 inhibitors, MMV00073, MMV397264 and MMV390482. Metabolomics analysis of cell pellets and spent media allowed reproducible detection of diverse metabolites from a range of metabolic pathways, with the most significant OSM-S-313-induced perturbations observed within peptide, lipid and energy metabolism, suggesting a specific impact on parasite metabolism.

Arabidopsis T87 suspension cells were treated with the pathogen-associated molecular pattern elf26 or a DMSO-control treatment for six hours, then incubated in fresh media for one hour. The conditioned medium (exudate) was collected from each culture by centrifugation and 0.22 um filter to remove plant cells. These samples are designated T=6 mock and T=6 elf26 in our experimental design. We also prepared samples in the same manner from control-treated cells except without any pre-treatment time prior to one hour exudate production. These samples are labeled T=0 mock. A total of seven biological replicates of each treatment condition were analyzed, with each replicate prepared from cells grown in separate flasks. The exudates were prepared in four independent experiments performed on separate days (1 biological replicate from first experiment, 2 biological replicates from each of the 3 remaining experiments). Four samples of the culture medium, one from each of the four independent experiments, are included.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000693	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M83H4H			Mayo Pilot and Feasibility: The pathogenic NMO IgG dysregulates the astrocytic glutamine-glutamate cycle: a metabolic basis for depression in NMO patients	Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a disabling central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory disorder that involves a pathogenic autoantibody (NMO IgG) directed against aquaporin-4, the major brain water channel, expressed on astrocytes. Astrocytes in brain tissue from patients with NMO exhibit a spectrum of abnormalities and pathologies ranging from sublytic gliosis and reactivity to outright destruction. Our current working model for NMO pathogenesis involves an early and robust NMO IgG-induced astrocytic stress response that drives metabolic dyshomeostasis and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that amplify pathology by recruiting innate immune effector cells to the CNS. Notably, astrocytes are implicated in clinical depression and patients with NMO experience depression at levels that exceed the general population. Preliminary magnetic resonance spectroscopy data from our group indicates that glutamate levels are reduced in the prefrontal cortex of NMO patients, suggesting that unipolar depression in these individuals is a direct pathogenic effect of NMO IgG-induced astrocytic dysregulation. Because astrocytes are critical for glutamine-glutamate cycling in the CNS, we hypothesize that stimulation of primary astrocytes with patient-derived NMO IgG will drive a metabolic shift marked by alterations in cellular levels of glutamate and glutamine. In preliminary experiments using 1H-NMR to measure metabolic changes induced in astrocytes by stimulation with NMO IgG we observed variable glutamate and glutamine responses. To overcome issues of signal-to-noise and the high basal levels of glutamate and glutamine produced by astrocytes, we now propose to use isotopic tracing and 13C-NMR to quantify NMO IgG-induced metabolic dysregulation. Our ultimate goal is to use NMO IgG-induced dyshomeostasis as a microscope to reveal basic mechanisms of pathogenic glutamate-glutamine metabolism in astrocytes that may not only impact the health of patients with NMO but may also yield novel insights into the mechanisms of depression in general.

Using 1H-NMR, we identified 14 metabolites that significantly differed between maternal and fetal placental tissues (FDR-corrected p-value < 0.05), with 12 metabolites elevated in the maternal tissue, reflecting the flux of these metabolites from mother to fetus. In the maternal tissue, 4 metabolites were significantly altered at 15 min, 10 metabolites at 30 min, and 16 metabolites at 1 h postdelivery, while 11 metabolites remained stable over 24 h. In contrast, in the fetal placenta tissue, 1 metabolite was significantly altered at 15 min, 2 metabolites at 30 min, and 4 metabolites at 1 h postdelivery, while 22 metabolites remained stable over 24 h. Our study provides information on the metabolic profiles of maternal and fetal placental tissues delivered by cesarean section and reveals that there are different metabolic alterations in the maternal and fetal tissues of the placenta following delivery.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000696	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8Q96S			Pregnancy Eating and Postpartum Diapers (PEAPOD)	This was a pilot study (n=27), to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of implementing a randomized controlled trial of a diet intervention in pregnancy designed to test the effect of maternal diet on the maternal and infant gut microbiome. Our specific aims were to: 1) test feasibility of enrollment and implementation; 2) assess acceptability of weekly food deliveries; and 3) estimate the preliminary effect size of the intervention relative to the usual care group on (a) maternal gut butyrate composition measured in three maternal stool samples collected at two time points during pregnancy (pre- and post-diet intervention phase) and also collected at 6 weeks postpartum; and (b) infant gut butyrate composition measured in infant stool samples collected at 6 weeks of age. The overall goal of PEAPOD was to gather pilot data to effectively refine the intervention so that it can be tested in a larger, longer study using a factorial design. For this pilot, we employed a 2-arm RCT with a total sample size of 27 mother-child pairs. We enrolled women in mid-pregnancy who were intending to breastfeed, randomized them to the diet intervention (n=13) or to a usual care group (n=14) and followed them to 6 weeks postpartum. Data collection included surveys of detailed maternal dietary information, as well as collection of maternal blood, urine, and stool at three time points (25 and 36 weeks gestation, and 6 weeks postpartum), and an infant stool sample at 6 weeks of age along with information about infant feeding practices. The diet intervention was initiated at 32 weeks gestation and continued until birth of the baby; thus the 25 week gestation biospecimens are pre-intervention and the 36 week gestation biospecimens are after 4 weeks of receiving the diet intervention. We chose to collect the second set of biospecimens at 36 weeks gestation to avoid missing post-intervention samples in instances where women delivered preterm. We partnered with the hospital catering service and the diet intervention including either legumes (e.g. minestrone with white beans) or whole grains (e.g. beef barley), and 5 pieces of fresh fruit (e.g. apples, oranges). In addition, in the first week, participants received a collection of non-perishable high fiber foods (whole wheat breakfast cereal, oatmeal, dried fruit, and canned beans) as well as upscale olive oil and vinegar from a local store along with recipes for salad dressing, side dishes, and some general information about the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet. We anticipated that participants would likely share the food with their families but our intent was to provide enough supplementary food to increase the fiber consumption of the pregnant women.

The condition is characterized by chronic gut inflammation, malabsorption, stunting of growth, stunted villi, and reduced efficacy of oral vaccines. Due to the similarity of the gastrointestinal tract and immune response of swine and humans, the piglet is an attractive model for studying this condition. In this present study, piglets were challenged with either a chronic or acute dose of pathogenic E.coli in an attempt to mimic the symptoms of EE over a 7 day trial period.

This research sought to identify whether GC has a unique urinary metabolomic profile compared with benign gastric disease (BN) and healthy (HE) patients. Methods: Urine from 43 GC, 40 BN, and 40 matched HE patients was analysed using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy, generating 77 reproducible metabolites (QC-RSD <25%). Univariate and multivariate (MVA) statistics were employed. A parsimonious biomarker profile of GC vs HE was investigated using LASSO regularised logistic regression (LASSO-LR). Model performance was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: GC displayed a clear discriminatory biomarker profile; the BN profile overlapped with GC and HE. LASSO-LR identified three discriminatory metabolites: 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, 3-indoxylsulfate, and alanine, which produced a discriminatory model with an area under the ROC of 0.95. Conclusions: GC patients have a distinct urinary metabolite profile. This study shows clinical potential for metabolic profiling for early GC diagnosis.

Asthma is also the number one cause of school absences in America. The role of indoor allergen exposure in homes and asthma development and morbidity has been extensively studied. Because children spend a significant amount of time in school, the school classroom environment may be as significant a source of allergen exposure and consequent asthma morbidity as allergen exposure in the home. However, little is known about the role of allergen exposure in schools and asthma morbidity. We hypothesize that exposure to common indoor allergens in the classroom will increase the risk of asthma morbidity in inner-city children with asthma, even after controlling for home allergen exposures. In a longitudinal study of 300 elementary school-aged children with asthma from multiple classrooms in close to 40 inner-city schools, we will examine the following specific aims: 1) to test whether elevated levels of allergens in the classroom increase the risk of asthma morbidity, even after controlling for allergen exposure in the home; and 2) to test whether the risk of increased asthma morbidity in relation to elevated classroom levels of a specific allergen will be highest for those specifically sensitized to that allergen. An understanding of exposure risk factors specific to the school classroom is critical, because the school classroom environment could potentially be considered as an effective target for prevention of inner-city asthma morbidity by reducing exposures to many symptomatic children through school- based interventions. While the potential importance of the classroom environment to the health of asthmatic children has been recognized nationally, study of this area has lacking. This unique application will build on significant collaborations between the Channing Laboratory at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Children's Hospital Boston, the Harvard School of Public Health, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and the Boston Public School System. Our multidisciplinary research group has significant expertise in asthma epidemiology and environmental epidemiology (Drs. Phipatanakul and Gold), environmental assessment (Drs. Phipatanakul, Gold, Muilenberg, and Rogers), and statistics (Drs. Ryan, Hoffman, and Subramanian). In addition to its public health relevance, this proposal will recruit a unique school pediatric cohort that will facilitate future hypothesis testing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is a disease that affects more than 12% of Americans under the age of 18 for over 14 million missed school days per year, and is the number one cause of school absences in America. Elementary school children spend 6 to 10 hours a day in school, and most of that time is spent in one classroom. The goals of this project are to provide an understanding of exposure risk factors specific to the classroom. This is critical, because the classroom environment could potentially be considered as an effective target for prevention of inner-city asthma morbidity by reducing exposures to many symptomatic children through an intervention in the school classrooms.; SICAS 2: Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood in the United States, causes significant morbidity, particularly in the inner-city, and accounts for billions of dollars in health care utilization, despite aggressive measures to identify remediable causes. Home environments are established sources of exposure that exacerbate symptoms and home-based interventions are proven effective. Prior to the inception of the School Inner-City Asthma Study (SICAS-1), no American study had comprehensively evaluated the relationship between urban exposures in school, classroom, and home environments and asthma morbidity. Nearly all elementary school children spend 6 to 10 hours a day in school, and most of that time is spent in one classroom. From SICAS-1, we learned that student classroom-specific mouse allergen, mold, and particulate pollutant exposure is associated with worsening symptoms. We also demonstrated our ability to reduce these exposures in a busy, school setting. Our proposal builds upon our established, successful school-based infrastructure to determine whether a school/classroom intervention will efficiently and effectively improve asthma morbidity by reducing these exposures. Our goal is to determine the efficacy of school/classroom based environmental intervention in reducing asthma morbidity in urban schoolchildren. Our central hypothesis is that reducing classroom/school exposure to mouse allergen, mold, and particulate pollutants will decrease asthma morbidity in students with asthma. We plan to test this hypothesis in an intervention study of 300 elementary students with asthma from multiple classrooms in 40 Boston inner-city elementary schools. Our clinical trial aims are to determine the effectiveness of a school/classroom based environmental intervention (school integrated pest management and classroom air purifying filter units within these schools) to reduce asthma morbidity.This study is an unprecedented, high impact opportunity to test whether we can efficiently benefit a community of children in the school environment as opposed to individuals in single homes. It also adds a novel mechanistic application on health outcomes. It efficiently tackles a critical public health problem that affects a growing proportion of disadvantaged, urban U.S. children.

Lipid profiles reflected pansteatitis severity and were significantly different between diseased and healthy individuals. Over 13 classes of lipids associated with inflammation, cell death, and/or oxidative damage were upregulated in pansteatitis-affected adipose tissue, including ether-lipids, short-chained triglyceride oxidation products, sphingolipids, and acylcarnitines. Ceramides showed a 1000-fold increase in the most affected adipose tissues, illustrating its potential as sensitive and novel indicators of disease severity. In plasma, triglycerides were found to be downregulated in pansteatitis-affected tilapia. As comprehensive coverage of the lipidome aids in the elucidation of possible disease mechanisms, application of lipidomics could be applied to the understanding of other environmentally-derived inflammatory conditions, such as those caused by obesogens.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000706	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8DT2N			Skin and Blubber Metabolomics	The common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is carnivorous cetacean thriving in marine environment are one of the most common apex predators found in coastal and estuarine ecosystems. Although recent studies have focused on capturing the circulating metabolomes of these organisms, with respect to pollutants and exposures of the marine environment, the skin and blubber are important protective organs that have not been probed. Using 1HNMR based untargeted metabolomics we quantified 51 metabolites belonging to 74 different metabolic pathways in the skin and blubber of bottle nose dolphins (n=5) samples collected in 2017 from the coast of Mexico. Results indicate that the skin and blubber metabolism are quantitatively different. These metabolite abundances could help discriminate the tissue-types using supervised and unsupervised PCA and PLSDA analysis. Heat maps and random forest analysis point to unique metabolites that are important classifiers of the tissue-type. The altered metabolic patterns, mainly linking fatty acid metabolism and ketogenic amino acids, seem to constitute a characteristic of blubber, while the skin showed diverse metabolites involved in gluceoneogenic pathways. 1H NMR spectra allowed the identification of metabolites associated with these organ types, such as pyruvic acid, arginine, ornithine, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid, and acetic acid, as discriminatory and classifying metabolites. These results would lead to further understanding of dolphin skin and blubber metabolism for better efforts in their conservation as well as a measure of marine pollution and ecotoxicology.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000708	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8596T			Metabolic approaches reveal the role of CAR in energy metabolism	The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR; NR1I3) contributes important regulatory roles in biotransformation, xenobiotic transport function, energy metabolism and lipid homeostasis. In this investigation, global serum and liver tissue metabolomes were assessed analytically in wild type and CAR-null transgenic mice using NMR, GC/MS and UPLC/MS-MS-based metabolomics. Significantly, CAR activation increased serum levels of fatty acids, lactate, ketone bodies and tricarboxylic acid cycle products, whereas levels of phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, amino acids and liver glucose were decreased following short-term activation of CAR. Mechanistically, quantitative mRNA analysis demonstrated significantly decreased expression of key gluconeogenic pathways, and increased expression of glucose utilization pathways, changes likely resulting from down-regulation of the hepatic glucose sensor and bi-directional transporter, Glut2. Short-term CAR activation also resulted in enhanced fatty acid synthesis and impaired ß-oxidation. In summary, CAR contributes an expansive role regulating energy metabolism, significantly impacting glucose, and monocarboxylic acid, as well as fatty acid metabolism and lipid homeostasis, through receptor-mediated regulation of several genes in multiple associated pathways.

We report excellent extraction method for cyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus, viz., Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, and a newly isolated Synechococcus elongatus PCC 11801 (manuscript under review). High resolution-LC/MS was used to assess the relative abundance of the extracted metabolites. The different solvent systems used for extraction led to statistically significant changes in the extraction efficiency for a large number of metabolites. While a few hundred m/z features or potential metabolites were detected with different solvent systems, the abundance of over a quarter of all metabolites varied significantly from one solvent system to another. Further, the extraction methods were evaluated for a targeted set of metabolites that are important in 13C-MFA studies of photosynthetic organisms. While for the strain PCC 7002, the reported method using methanol-chloroform-water system gave satisfactory results, a mild base in the form of NH4OH had to be used in place of water to achieve adequate levels of extraction for PCC 7942 and PCC 11801.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000711	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8S383			Multi-omics Approach Reveals Metabolic Changes in the Heart at Birth	During late gestation, the fetal heart primarily relies on glucose and lactate to support rapid growth and development. While numerous studies describe changes in heart metabolism a few weeks after birth to preferentially utilize fatty acids, little is known about metabolic changes of the heart within the first day following birth. Therefore, we used the ovine model of pregnancy to investigate metabolic differences between the near-term fetal and the newborn heart. Samples were collected for metabolomic, lipidomic, and transcriptomic approaches from the left and right ventricles and intraventricular septum in 7 fetuses at gestational day 142 and 7 newborn lambs on the day of birth. We observed greater abundance of metabolites involved in butanoate and propanoate metabolism, and glycolysis in the term fetal heart (FDR-corrected p<0.10) and differential expression in these pathways were confirmed with single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) (FDR-corrected p<0.05). Immediately following birth, newborn hearts displayed enrichment in purine, fatty acid, and glycerophospholipid metabolic pathways, as well as oxidative phosphorylation with significant alterations in both lipids and metabolites to support transcriptomic findings. While other studies suggest a switch from carbohydrate metabolism to fatty acid metabolism in the neonatal heart in as early as 2 weeks following birth, our data show that this metabolic switch in the heart begins by the first day of postnatal life. A better understanding of metabolic alterations that occur in the heart following birth may improve treatment of neonates at risk for heart failure.

However, cachexia symptoms induced by gliomas and mechanisms underlying muscle atrophy are unclear. Herein, we developed a glioma cachexia model using nude mice orthotopicly implanted with two glioma cell lines (WHO II CHG5 and WHO IV U87). U87 mice developed more severe cachexia symptoms than CHG5 mice, including more evident anorexia, greater body weight loss and mortality. Unlike non-central nervous system cancer cachexia, glioma cachexia did not induce remarkable systemic inflammation but massive multi-organ atrophy. It also caused significantly decreased skeletal muscle mass and strength, which were associated with down-regulated myosin and AKT, and up-regulated AMPK, FOXO and Atrogin1. Interestingly, expressions of MuRF1, MyoD1, eIF3f, desmin and vimentin were not significantly changed. Consistently, NMR-based metabolomic analyses revealed pronounced metabolic derangements in cachectic gastrocnemius relative to controls. Glucose, glycerol, 3-hydroxybutyrate and glycine were remarkably down-regulated, whereas largely released amino acids due to proteolysis including glutamate, arginine, leucine and isoleucine were up-regulated in cachectic gastrocnemius. Moreover, glucose and lipid metabolism, protein biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism were disturbed dramatically in both glioma-bearing mice. U87 mice showed more changed metabolite levels and altered metabolic pathways. This work uncovers malignant grade-dependent glioma cachexia symptoms and metabolic derangements of skeletal muscle for the first time, and provides hints for new therapeutic approaches.

However, specific mechanisms affecting disease susceptibility related to complex commensal bacterial mixtures are poorly understood. We used a multi-omics approach to determine how differences in the complex gut microbiome (GM) influence the metabolome and host transcriptome and ultimately affect susceptibility to adenoma development. Fecal samples collected from a preclinical rat model of colon cancer harboring distinct complex GMs were analyzed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). We collected samples prior to observable disease onset and identified putative metabolite profiles that predicted future disease severity, independent of GM status. Transcriptome analyses performed after disease onset from normal epithelium and tumor tissues between the high and low tumor GMs suggests that the GM is also correlated with altered host gene expression. Integrated pathway (IP) analyses of the metabolome and transcriptome based on putatively identified metabolic features indicate that bile acid biosynthesis was enriched in rats with high tumors (GM:F344) along with increased fatty acid metabolism and mucin biosynthesis. These data emphasize the utility of using untargeted metabolomics to reveal signatures of susceptibility and resistance and integrated analysis reveals common pathways that are likely to be universal targets for intervention.

It plays a protective role in pathogenic processes such as intestinal colitis and tumorigenesis in a microbiome dependent manner. Host innate immunity and changes in microbial diversity also play a role in the severity of allo-immune-mediated gastrointestinal pathogenic process, namely graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the principal toxicity after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). Herein, we examined the role of NLRP6 in multiple murine models of allo-BMT. In contrast to its role in intestinal colitis, host NLRP6 aggravated GI GVHD. NLRP6-deficient animals showed improved intestinal barrier function, increased levels of tissue repair associated proteins and preserved Goblet and Paneth cell numbers in the GI tract after allo-BMT. The impact of host NLRP6 deficiency in mitigating GVHD was observed regardless of co-housing, antibiotic treatment, or colonizing littermate germ free wild type (WT) and NLRP6 deficient hosts with fecal microbial transplantation from SPF WT and Nlrp6-/- animals. Chimera studies were performed to assess the role of NLRP6 expression on host hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. The allogeneic [B6Ly5.2?Nlrp6-/-] animals demonstrated significantly improved survival compared to the allogeneic [B6Ly5.2?B6] animals, demonstrating that the absence of NLRP6 in host non-hematopoietic cells is crucial for the protection against GVHD, but did not alter the therapeutic graft-versus-tumor effects after BMT. Our results unveil a novel role for NLRP6 and demonstrate a pathogenic role in GVHD that is independent of variations in its intestinal microbiome in contrast to its well-appreciated microbiome-dependent protective role in intestinal colitis and tumorigenesis.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000730	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M89X1C			Aspirin Metabolomics in Colorectal Cancer Chemoprevention (part 1 - Colon)	Substantial evidence supports the effectiveness of aspirin for cancer chemoprevention in addition to its well established role in cardiovascular protection. In recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in humans, daily aspirin use reduced incidence, metastasis and mortality from several common types of cancer, especially colorectal cancer. The mechanism(s) by which aspirin exerts an anticancer benefit is uncertain; numerous effects have been described involving both cyclooxygenase-dependent and -independent pathways. The goal of this research is to elucidate the key metabolic changes that are responsible for the anticancer effects of aspirin in humans using untargeted metabolomics analysis. Metabolomics, or global metabolite profiling, is an emerging discipline that has the potential to transform the study of pharmaceutical agents. Our innovative approach will use high-resolution mass spectroscopy to detect thousands of metabolites in blood plasma and normal colon mucosa biopsies that were collected from participants in the Aspirin/Folate Polyp Prevention Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of aspirin and/or folic acid supplementation for the prevention of colorectal adenomas. Participants in the trial were assigned with equal probability to three aspirin treatment arms (placebo, 81 mg, or 325 mg daily). Over the three-year treatment period, 81 mg/day of aspirin reduced the risk of adenomas, whereas the 325 mg/day dose had less effect. The aims of the current proposal are to identify metabolomic signatures, including specific metabolites and metabolic pathways, that are associated with aspirin treatment in blood and normal colon mucosal tissue of participants after three years of randomized aspirin treatment; and then to assess the associations of these metabolic signatures with adenoma risk and whether they mediate the reductions in risk due to 81 mg/day aspirin treatment. We will prioritize metabolites for study by evaluating metabolite levels in patients from the placebo and treatment arms while controlling the false discovery rate, use correlation analysis to enhance identification of relevant metabolic modules associated with these prioritized metabolites, and apply pathway mapping with post-hoc application of ion dissociation spectroscopy to representative metabolites to confirm pathway identification. Because aspirin is a multifunctional drug that is thought to modify numerous pathways with potential roles in carcinogenesis, a global discovery-based metabolomics approach is the best way to identify its key activities. The public health significance of this work is substantial because understanding the mechanism of aspirin’s anticancer effects is key to optimizing its use and to the development of novel drugs targeting the metabolic pathways identified.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000732	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M82D79			Adverse effects of PAHs on lung cells	Low-molecular-weight (LMW) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are more prevalent in the environment, occupational settings, as well as in secondhand smoke (SHS), when compared to their high molecular weight counterparts, such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). Previously, we demonstrated that SHS-prevalent LMW PAHs activate p38-MAPK-dependent dysregulation of gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) and increased cytokines involved in inflammatory lung diseases. However, there is little known about the early mechanistic events leading to inflammation, specifically those mediated through lipid signaling and eicosanoids. Secondhand smoke is a complex mixture and to model this feature in vitro we examined the effects of a binary mixture of 1-methylanthracene (1-MeA) and fluoranthene (Flthn) in C10 cells, a mouse, non-tumorigenic alveolar type II cell line via a global metabolomics approach to evaluate the lipids.

Contributing factors likely include lifestyle and atypical antipsychotic (AAP) use, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The objective of this study was to identify metabolomic variability in adult patients with schizophrenia who were taking AAPs and grouped by fasting insulin concentration, our surrogate marker for metabolic risk. DESIGN Metabolomics analysis. PARTICIPANTS Ninety-four adult patients with schizophrenia who were taking an AAP for at least 6 months, with no changes in their antipsychotic regimen for the previous 8 weeks, and who did not require treatment with insulin. Twenty age- and sex-matched nonobese (10 subjects) and obese (10 subjects) controls without cardiovascular disease or mental health diagnoses were used to match the body mass index range of the patients with schizophrenia to account for metabolite concentration differences attributable to body mass index. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Existing serum samples were used to identify aqueous metabolites (to differentiate fasting insulin concentration quartiles) and fatty acids with quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography (GC) methods, respectively. To exclude metabolites from our pathway mapping analysis that were due to variability in weight, we also subjected serum samples from the nonobese and obese controls to the same analyses. Patients with schizophrenia had a median age of 47.0 (interquartile range 41.0-52.0) years. Using a false discovery rate threshold of <25%, 10 metabolites, not attributable to weight, differentiated insulin concentration quartiles in patients with schizophrenia and identified variability in one-carbon metabolism between groups. Patients with higher fasting insulin concentrations (quartiles 3 and 4) also trended toward having higher levels of saturated fatty acids compared with patients with lower fasting insulin concentrations (quartiles 1 and 2). CONCLUSION These results illustrate the utility of metabolomics to identify pathways underlying variable fasting insulin concentration in patients with schizophrenia. Importantly, no significant difference in AAP exposure was observed among groups, suggesting that current antipsychotic use may not be a primary factor that differentiates middle-aged adult patients with schizophrenia by fasting insulin concentration.

The latter is gaining increasing attention due to advances in modeling and new analytical methods that provide dense time-series data. We extended high-resolution-magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) NMR—an established technique to measure metabolites from tissues and live organisms—into a flexible, untargeted, and continuous recording of in vivo metabolism. We call this technique “continuous in vivo metabolism by NMR” (CIVM-NMR). We used isotope-edited CIVM-NMR to reproduce a recent amino acid flux result in chronic lymphoid leukemia cells. We then collected untargeted CIVM-NMR datasets for Neurospora crassa, a classic multicellular model of biochemistry, genetics, and metabolism. CIVM-NMR requires virtually no sample preparation and allows for continuous collection of data over hours to days at ~4-min temporal resolution with little noise. CIVM-NMR provided real-time measurements that unambiguously reproduced the direction of flux of branched-chain amino acid accumulation in leukemia cells. It also revealed the dynamics of central carbon metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy storage molecules, and lipid and cell wall precursors in N. crassa. CIVM-NMR is simple and readily adapted to different types of cells and microorganisms, making it ideally suited to experimentally complement kinetic models of metabolism for diverse biological systems.

Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of the fetal heart suggested alterations in TCA cycle intermediates and lipid metabolites in animals exposed to excess cortisol in utero. Therefore, we utilized a sheep model of pregnancy to determine how chronic increases in maternal cortisol alter maternal and fetal serum prior to birth and neonatal cardiac metabolites and lipids at term. Ewes were either infused with 1 mg/kg/day of cortisol starting at gestational day 115 (n=9), or untreated (n=6). Serum was collected from the mother and fetus (125 d-birth), and hearts were collected following birth. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy was conducted to measure metabolic profiles of newborn heart specimens as well as fetal and maternal serum specimens. Mass spectrometry was conducted to measure lipid profiles of newborn heart specimens. We observed alterations in amino acid and TCA cycle metabolism as well as lipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism in newborn hearts after excess maternal cortisol in late gestation. In addition, we observed alterations in amino acid and TCA cycle metabolites in fetal but not in maternal serum during late gestation. These results suggest that fetal exposure to excess maternal cortisol alters placental and fetal metabolism prior to birth and limits normal cardiac metabolic maturation, which may contribute to increased risk of peripartum cardiac arrhythmias observed in these animals, or later life cardiomyopathies.

Therefore, knowledge of microenvironmental nutrient levels is essential to understand tumor metabolism. To measure the extracellular nutrient levels available to tumors, we developed a quantitative metabolomics method to measure the absolute concentrations of >118 metabolites in plasma and tumor interstitial fluid, the extracellular fluid that perfuses tumors. Comparison of nutrient levels in tumor interstitial fluid and plasma revealed that the nutrients available to tumors differ from those present in circulation. Further, by comparing interstitial fluid nutrient levels between autochthonous and transplant models of murine pancreatic and lung adenocarcinoma, we found that tumor type, anatomical location and animal diet affect local nutrient availability. These data provide a comprehensive characterization of the nutrients present in the tumor microenvironment of widely used models of lung and pancreatic cancer and identify factors that influence metabolite levels in tumors.

We hypothesized that sphingolipids mediate intestinal health as they were identified as the most upregulated metabolite feature in stool of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Commensal Bacteroidetes also produce sphingolipids, but the impact of these metabolites on host pathways is largely uncharacterized. To study Bacteroidetes sphingolipids in intestinal health, we colonized germ-free mice with a sphingolipid-deficient Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain. A lack of Bacteroides-derived sphingolipids increased intestinal inflammation, dysregulated innate immunity and altered the host ceramide pool. Using metabolomic analysis, we described the Bacteroides sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway and revealed a greater variety of Bacteroides-derived sphingolipids than previously recognized, including ceramide phosphoinositol and deoxy-sphingolipids. We annotated Bacteroides sphingolipids in an IBD metabolomic dataset, discovering lower abundances in IBD and negative correlations with gut inflammation and host sphingolipid production. These data highlight the role of sphingolipids in maintaining host-bacterial symbiosis and intestinal homeostasis.

Although MeJA is applied experimentally to mimic herbivory and induce plant defences, its downstream effects on the plant metabolome are yet largely uncharacterized, especially in the context of plant primary growth and the tissue-specificity of the response. Objectives: We investigated the growth and defence metabolome responses and resistance properties induced by MeJA and real caterpillar herbivory across different leaf stages of the wild annual plant Brassica nigra. Methods: MeJA- and mock-sprayed plants were consecutively treated with or without caterpillars. Foliar cell-bound compounds and herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) were analysed combining gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (TOF/MS). Additionally, gene transcript analyses were performed in Arabidopsis. Results: Plant responses were stronger in young leaves which simultaneously induced higher chlorophyll levels. Both MeJA and caterpillars induced similar, but not identical, accumulation of tricarboxylic acids (TCAs), glucosinolates (GSLs) and phenylpropanoids (PPs), but only caterpillars led to depletion in amino acids. Caterpillars gained less weight when feeding on MeJA-treated plants, indicative of reduced host-plant quality and enhanced resistance. MeJA also caused a three-fold increase in the major defence compound allyl-GSL (sinigrin) upon caterpillar feeding, but did not alter HIPV profiles. Conclusions: The metabolomics approach showed how plant responses induced by real and simulated herbivory extend beyond the regulation of defence metabolism and are tightly modulated throughout leaf development. This leads to a new understanding of the plant metabolic potential that can be further exploited for future plant protection strategies.

Here we report a safe mUncoupler, OPC-163493, which has unique pharmacokinetic characteristics. OPC-163493 shows a good bioavailability upon oral administration and primarily distributed to specific organs: the liver and kidneys, avoiding systemic toxicities. It exhibitsinsulin-independent antidiabetic effects in multiple animal models of type I and type II diabetes and antisteatotic effects in fatty liver models. These beneficial effects can be explained by the improvement of glucose metabolism and enhancement of energy expenditure by OPC-163493 in the liver. Moreover, OPC-163493 treatment lowered blood pressure, extended survival, and improved renal function in the rat model of stroke/hypertension, possibly by enhancing NO bioavailability in blood vessels and reducing mitochondrial ROS production. OPC-163493 is a liver-localized/targeted mUncoupler that ameliorates various complications of diabetes.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000764	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8XH5B			Microbial depletion and ozone exposure	Ozone is an asthma trigger. In mice, the gut microbiome contributes to ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, a defining feature of asthma. The purpose of this study was to identify metabolites that could be mediating this role. Gut bacterial enzymes modify ingested substances producing metabolites that enter the blood and circulate to host tissues where they may exert a variety of effects. Therefore, we performed global metabolomic profiling on serum of mice after acute ozone exposure. To identify the role of the microbiome in mediating ozone-induced metabolomic changes, mice were treated for two weeks with a cocktail of antibiotics in the drinking water or with control water and then exposed to air or ozone (2 ppm for 3 hours). Twenty four hours later, blood was harvested and serum analyzed via liquid-chromatography or gas-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. We observed marked effects of both ozone exposure and antibiotics on the serum metabolome. Known bacterially-derived metabolites were reduced in antibiotic-treated mice. Importantly, our data also indicated that ozone-induced changes in serum lipids, including long chain fatty acids and bile acids, as well as ozone-induced changes in polyamines were different in control and antibiotic-treated mice. Each of these metabolites has the capacity to alter airway responsiveness and may account for the role of the microbiome in pulmonary responses to ozone.

Increased triglyceride concentration in muscle tissue, as seen with obesity, is associated with inhibition of insulin action and decreased glucose uptake. Here we use liquid chromatography paired with mass spectrometry (LCMS) to identify patterns of lipid species in femoral muscle of mice associated with diet-induced insulin resistance. Mice were fed a standard CHOW diet for 5 weeks or HFD for 5 or 13 weeks. 806 lipids were significantly different (p = 0.05) between HFD-induced insulin resistant muscle and CHOW insulin sensitive. Of these 217 lipid species were quantified and annotated based on principle components analysis, significance (p = 0.01) and fold change of relative abundance values. CHOW insulin sensitive muscle was associated with triglycerides and phospholipids that contained higher abundance of long-chain highly unsaturated fatty acids. Serine and inositol phospholipids favored insulin sensitive femoral muscle, yet higher abundance also occurred in 13 week HFD mice compared with 5 week. Consequently, phospholipid imbalance may be indicative of cell membrane dysfunction. HFD insulin resistant femoral muscle contained triglycerides with less carbons, compared with CHOW, which were predominantly saturated. In addition, there was greater abundance of diacylglycerides and sphingomyelin, but not ceramides. Extending HFD intake to 13 weeks did not cause increased abundance of deleterious lipids with the exception of sphingomyelin. Overall, distinct lipid combinations, perhaps even ratios, should be characterized when identifying what contributes to the maintenance or dysregulation of muscle insulin sensitivity.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms contributing to HCC development and progression is highly desirable for improved surveillance, diagnosis and treatment. Liver tissue metabolomics has the potential to reflect the physiological changes behind HCC development. Also, it allows researchers to investigate racial disparities in HCC. The use of both gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platforms helps increase the metabolome coverage, allowing researchers to better unravel the relationships of metabolites and HCC. The objective of this study is to identify HCC-associated metabolites by analysis of liver tissues from HCC patients using both GC-MS and LC-MS platforms. Paired tumor and non-tumor tissues from 40 patients were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS. The patients consist of 14 African-Americans (AA), 10 Asian-Americans (AS), and 16 European-Americans (EA). The levels of the metabolites extracted from the solid liver tissue of the HCC area and adjacent non-HCC area were compared. Among the analytes detected by GC-MS and LC-MS with significant alterations, 17 were selected based on availability of putative metabolite identifications. These metabolites belong to TCA cycle, glycolysis, purines, and lipid metabolism, and have been previously reported in liver metabolomics studies where high correlation with HCC progression was implied. We demonstrated that metabolites that are related to HCC pathogenesis can be identified through metabolomics analysis of liver tissues by both GC-MS and LC-MS. In addition, this analysis has led to the identification of metabolites associated with HCC in a race-specific manner.

In parallel control groups, conv (n=6) and GF (n=6) mice received saline via minipumps. Our primary goal was to identify metabolites which were differentially regulated in conventional mice treated with AngII, but not in GF mice, indicating that these metabolites are microbial in origin. Following minipump implantation, animals were housed singly to prevent cross-contamination of microbiota. At the end of fourth week, feces and blood were collected. Both plasma and feces samples were processed and analyzed by using Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) for metabolite detection (Metabolon).

There are few major vendors for LC-MS platform instruments, for example, Thermo ScientificTM LTQ Orbitrap Velos and Agilent 6510 Q-TOF mass spectrometer were used for metabolomics research. The data acquired cross different platform are rarely compared other than the comparison of the instrument itself on resolution, mass accuracy, sensitivity, dynamic range, scan speed etc., which is largely due to the foundation and principle of the instrument design. Other than this, there are many choice for data preprocessing, i.e., the data acquired from the same platform may have been processed with different feature extraction software tools. The discrepancy for the feature detections with different software will lead to the variation of the down-stream statistics analysis and metabolomics pathway interpretation. In addition, the impact of the LC-MS platform and data preprocessing software tools on the quantitative capabilities is also an interesting topic. In this research, XCMS, mzMine 2.37 and apLCMS are three tools used for the feature extraction of data acquired with Thermo ScientificTM LTQ Orbitrap Velos and Agilent 6510 Q-TOF LC-MS platform by serial dilution experiment. The quantification capability is estimated at the same time based on the linearity, accuracy, and precision

PM and MetSyn are strong risk factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. After the World Trade Center collapse in 9/11/2001, PM-exposed individuals from the Fire Department of New York City (FDNY) developed a progressively lung disease. This nested case-cohort study is composed of never smoking, WTC exposed firefighters with normal pre-9/11 lung function presenting for subspecialty pulmonary evaluation (SPE) before March 2008. Representative cohort controls with serum drawn within six months of 9/11 (n=100).

High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common and deadliest ovarian cancer (OC) type, accounting for 70–80% of OC deaths. This high mortality is largely due to late diagnosis. Early detection is thus crucial to reduce mortality. Yet tumor pathogenesis of HGSC remains poorly understood, making early detection difficult. Faithfully and reliably representing the clinical nature of human HGSC, a recently-developed triple knockout (TKO) mouse model offers a unique opportunity to examine the entire disease spectrum of HGSC. Deep metabolomics study was performed to serum samples collected from these mice to understand the metabolic alternations associated with HGSC development and progression, and provide guidance toward early detection.

The staphylococcal respiratory regulator (SrrAB) modulates energy metabolism in Staphylococcus aureus. Studies have suggested that regulated protein catabolism facilitates energy homeostasis. Regulated proteolysis in S. aureus is achieved through protein complexes composed of a peptidase (ClpQ or ClpP) in association with an AAA+ family ATPase (typically ClpC or ClpX). In the current report, we tested the hypothesis that SrrAB regulates a Clp complex to facilitate energy homeostasis in S. aureus. Strains deficient in one or more Clp complexes are attenuated for growth in the presence of puromycin, which causes enrichment of misfolded proteins. A ?srrAB strain had increased sensitivity to puromycin. Epistasis experiments suggested that the puromycin sensitivity phenotype of the ?srrAB strain was a result of decreased ClpC activity. Consistent with this, transcriptional activity of clpC was decreased in the ?srrAB mutant and overexpression of clpC suppressed the puromycin sensitivity of the ?srrAB strain. Genetic studies suggested that phosphorylated SrrA is required to influence puromycin resistance. ClpC positively influenced respiration in association with ClpP. ClpP was also required for optimal fermentative growth, whereas ClpC was dispensable. Metabolomics studies demonstrated that intracellular metabolic profiles of the ?clpC and ?srrAB mutants are distinct from the wild type strain, supporting the notion that both ClpC and SrrAB affect central metabolism. We propose a model wherein SrrAB regulates energy homeostasis, in part, via modulation of regulated proteolysis.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000787	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8Z97B			Multi-omics analysis demonstrates unique mode of action of a potent new antimalarial compound, JPC-3210, against Plasmodium falciparum	The increasing incidence of antimalarial drug resistance to the first-line artemisinins, and their combination partner drugs, underpins an urgent need for new antimalarial drugs, ideally with a novel mechanism of action. The recently developed 2-aminomethylphenol, JPC-3210, (MMV 892646) is an erythrocytic schizonticide with potent in vitro antimalarial activity against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, low cytotoxicity, potent in vivo efficacy against murine malaria, and favourable preclinical pharmacokinetics, including a lengthy plasma elimination half-life. This study demonstrates the application of a “multi-omics” workflow based on high resolution orbitrap mass spectrometry to investigate the impact of JPC-3210 on biochemical pathways within P. falciparum infected red blood cells. Metabolomics and peptidomics analysis revealed a perturbation in hemoglobin metabolism following JPC-3210 exposure. The metabolomics data demonstrated a depletion in short hemoglobin-derived peptides, while peptidomics analysis showed a depletion in longer hemoglobin-derived peptides. In order to further elucidate the mechanism responsible for inhibition of hemoglobin metabolism, we used in vitro ß-hematin polymerisation assays and showed JPC-3210 to be an intermediate inhibitor of ß-hematin polymerisation, about 10-fold less potent then the quinoline antimalarials. Furthermore, quantitative proteomics analysis showed that JPC-3210 treatment results in a distinct proteomic signature in comparison to other known antimalarials. Whilst JPC-3210 clustered closely with mefloquine in the metabolomics and proteomics analyses, a key differentiating signature for JPC-3210 was the significant enrichment of parasite proteins involved in regulation of translation. In conclusion, multi-omics studies using high resolution mass spectrometry revealed JPC-3210 to possess a unique mechanism of action involving inhibition of hemoglobin digestion, depletion of DNA replication and synthesis proteins, and elevation of regulators of protein translation. Importantly, this mechanism is distinct from currently-used antimalarials, suggesting that JPC-3210 warrants further investigation as a potentially useful new antimalarial agent.

Metabolic derangements in hepatocytes controlled by SIRT1 indicate that this molecule plays a role in the development of fatty liver in inbred animals. The ability to perform similar studies using human tissue has been limited by the genetically variability in baseline SIRT1 expression in man. We now report generation of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells with controlled expression of SIRT1. By differentiating edited iPS cells into hepatocytes and then knocking down (KD) SIRT1, we found that downregulated SIRT1 regulates lipid homeostasis by increasing Srebp1c (a transcription factor driving fatty acid biosynthesis), and by decreasing PPARa and its transcriptional co-activator PGC1a, to exacerbate fat accumulation. To model human fatty livers, we repopulated the parenchyma of decellularized rat livers with human mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and human SIRT1-knockdown iPS-derived hepatocytes. When SIRT1-metabolism was modified, the human iPS-derived liver tissue developed macrosteatosis and generated cells with a proinflammatory phenotype. Our data indicate that SIRT1 plays an important role in the regulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis and inflammation in the human liver. Given the ability to generate and characterize bioengineered and genetically-edited human liver tissue, we believe that use of genetically modifiable human tissue may become an important tool for investigating human liver biology and disease.

We developed an approach for uncovering MoAs through an interpretable machine learning model of transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, and proteomics. Examining compounds with beneficial effects in models of Huntington’s Disease, we found common MoAs for compounds with unrelated structures, connectivity scores, and binding targets. The approach also predicted highly divergent MoAs for two FDA-approved antihistamines. We experimentally validated these effects, demonstrating that one antihistamine activates autophagy, while the other targets bioenergetics. The use of multiple omics was essential, as some MoAs were virtually undetectable in specific assays. Our approach does not require reference compounds or large databases of experimental data in related systems and thus can be applied to the study of agents with uncharacterized MoAs and to rare or understudied diseases.

Cordyceps militaris (C. militaris) is a commonly used substitute for O. sinensis. A metabolomic-based approach for exploring the similarities and differences in the metabolites of O. sinensis and C. militaris in water-boiled and 50% ethanol-soaked extracts is of great significance. Objectives To determine a vital role of extraction methodologies in influencing the metabolic composition of herbs, 1HNMR-based profiling was used to characterize the metabolic fingerprints of O. sinensis and C. militaris. Methods To make a distinction between the global metabolite profiling of O. sinensis and C. militaris extracts obtained from either the water-boiled or 50% ethanol-soaked methods, we screened the herbs samples using 1HNMR-based metabolic fingerprints combined with multivariate statistical analysis. Results This study revealed that a total of 43 (82.69% of 52) metabolites were detectable in both O. sinensis and C. militaris. According to the variable importance in projection (VIP) value and p-value from the Mann-Whitney test, 7 metabolites (alanine, aspartate, glutamate, mannitol, ornithine, serine, and trehalose) differed between O. sinensis and C. militaris. Arginine, glucose, putrescine, pyroglutamate, betaine, O-phosphocholine, and xylose differed significantly between the water-boiled and 50% ethanol-soaked methods used to prepare the herb extracts. Conclusion A total of 52 primary metabolites were identified and quantified from O. sinensis and C. militaris samples. The study suggests that a water-boiled extraction is much faster method and strongly recommended over the 50% ethanol-soaked method for both O. sinensis and C. militaris.

Our longitudinal data reveal (1) that microbial species maintain stable population sizes within and across humans, (2) that commonly used ‘omic survey methods are more reliable when using averages over multiple days of sampling, (3) that variation of gut metabolites within people over time is driven by amino acid levels, while differences across people are driven by differences in bile acids, and (4) that functional evolution and genomic diversification can be used to infer eco-evolutionary dynamics and in vivo selection pressures for strains within individual people. The BIO-ML is a unique resource that will enable hypothesis-driven microbiome research and the rational design of microbial therapeutics.

PCC 6803 under diurnal light:dark cycles	Cyanobacteria are a model photoautotroph and a chassis for the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals. Yet, knowledge of photoautotrophic metabolism in the natural environment of day/night cycles is lacking yet has implications for improved yield from plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. Here, a thorough approach to characterizing diverse metabolites—including carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, pigments, co-factors, nucleic acids and polysaccharides—in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (S. 6803) under sinusoidal diurnal light-dark cycles was developed and applied. A custom photobioreactor and novel multi-platform mass spectrometry workflow enabled metabolite profiling every 30-120 minutes across a 24-hour diurnal sinusoidal LD (“sinLD”) cycle peaking at 1,600 mol photons m 2 s-1. We report widespread oscillations across the sinLD cycle with 90%, 94%, and 40% of the identified polar/semi-polar, non-polar, and polymeric metabolites displaying statistically significant oscillations, respectively. Microbial growth displayed distinct lag, biomass accumulation, and cell division phases of growth. During the lag phase, amino acids (AA) and nucleic acids (NA) accumulated to high levels per cell followed by decreased levels during the biomass accumulation phase, presumably due to protein and DNA synthesis. Insoluble carbohydrates displayed sharp oscillations per cell at the day-to-night transition. Potential bottlenecks in central carbon metabolism are highlighted. Together, this report provides a comprehensive view of photosynthetic metabolite behavior with high temporal resolution, offering insight into the impact of growth synchronization to light cycles via circadian rhythms. Incorporation into computational modeling and metabolic engineering efforts promises to improve industrially-relevant strain design.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000809	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M83X38			System-wide biochemical analysis reveals ozonide and artemisinin antimalarials initially act by disrupting malaria parasite haemoglobin digestion	Artemisinins are currently the first-line antimalarials, and rely on a peroxide pharmacophore for their potent activity. OZ277 (arterolane) and OZ439 (artefenomel) are newer synthetic peroxide-based antimalarials with potent activity against the deadliest malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Here we used a “multi-omics” workflow, in combination with activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), to demonstrate that peroxide antimalarials initially target the haemoglobin (Hb) digestion pathway to kill malaria parasites. Time-dependent metabolomic profiling of peroxide-treated P. falciparum infected red blood cells (iRBCs) revealed a rapid depletion of short Hb-derived peptides, while untargeted peptidomics showed accumulation of longer Hb peptides. Quantitative proteomics and ABPP assays demonstrated that Hb digesting proteases were significantly increased in abundance and activity following treatment, respectively. The association between peroxide activity and Hb catabolism was also confirmed in a K13-mutant artemisinin resistant parasite line. To demonstrate that compromised Hb catabolism may be a primary mechanism involved in peroxide antimalarial activity, we showed that parasites forced to rely solely on Hb digestion for amino acids became hypersensitive to short peroxide exposures. Quantitative proteomics analysis also revealed parasite proteins involved in translation and the ubiquitin-proteasome system were enriched following drug treatment, suggestive of the parasite engaging a stress response to mitigate peroxide-induced damage. Taken together, these data point to a mechanism of action involving initial impairment of Hb catabolism, and indicate that the parasite regulates protein turnover to manage peroxide-induced damage.

In this study, the role of vitamin D in the regulation of microbe induced RORgt/FoxP3+ T regulatory (reg) cells in the colon was determined. Vitamin D sufficient (D+) mice had significantly higher frequencies of FoxP3+ and RORgt/FoxP3+ T reg cells in the colon compared to vitamin D deficient (D-) mice. The higher frequency of RORgt/FoxP3+ T reg cells in D+ colon correlated with higher numbers of bacteria from the Clostridium XIVa and Bacteroides in D+ compared to D- cecum. D- mice with fewer RORgt/FoxP3+ T reg cells were significantly more susceptible to colitis than D+ mice. Transfer of the cecal bacteria from D+ or D- mice to germfree recipients phenocopied the higher numbers of RORgt/FoxP3+ cells and reduced susceptibility to colitis in D+ versus D- recipient mice. 1,25(OH)2D treatment of the D- mice beginning at 3 weeks of age did not completely recover RORgt/FoxP3+ T reg cells or the Bacteriodes, Bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron, and Clostridium XIVa numbers to D+ values. Early vitamin D status shapes the microbiota to optimize the population of colonic RORgt/FoxP3+ T reg cells important for resistance to colitis.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000829	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8HX2M			Antimalarial pantothenamide metabolites target acetyl-CoA biosynthesis in Plasmodium falciparum	Malaria eradication is critically dependent on new therapeutics that target resistant Plasmodium parasites and block transmission of the disease. Here, we report the discovery of potent pantothenamide bioisosteres that are active against blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum parasites and that block transmission of sexual stages to the mosquito vector. These compounds were resistant to degradation by serum pantetheinases, showed favorable pharmacokinetic properties and cleared parasites in a humanized mouse infection model of P. falciparum. Metabolomics revealed that CoA biosynthetic enzymes converted pantothenamides into CoA-analogs that interfered with parasite acetyl-CoA anabolism. In vitro generated resistant parasites showed mutations in acetyl-CoA synthetase and acyl-CoA synthetase 11. Introduction and reversion of these mutations in P. falciparum by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing confirmed the key roles of these enzymes in the sensitivity of the malaria parasite to pantothenamides. These pantothenamide compounds with a unique mode of action may have potential as drugs against malaria parasites.

We report here a large metabolomics study of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid showing that people with DS produce elevated levels of kynurenine and quinolinic acid, two tryptophan catabolites with potent immunosuppressive and neurotoxic properties, respectively. We demonstrate that immune cells of people with DS overexpress IDO1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the kynurenine pathway (KP) and a known interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene. Furthermore, we show positive correlations among levels of IFN-inducible cytokines and KP dysregulation. Using metabolic tracing assays, we determine that IFN stimulation causes IDO1 overexpression and kynurenine overproduction in cells with T21, dependent on overexpression of IFN receptors encoded on chromosome 21. Finally, we show a mouse model of DS carrying triplication of the IFN receptors exhibits KP dysregulation. Altogether, these results reveal a mechanism by which T21 could drive immunosuppression and neurotoxicity in DS.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000831	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M88H5F			Uropathogenic versus Urocolonizing Escherichia coli	Urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent a major burden across the population, although key facets of their pathogenesis challenge physicians and investigators alike. Escherichia coli epitomizes these obstacles: this Gram-negative bacterial species is the most prevalent agent of UTIs worldwide and can also colonize the urogenital tract in a phenomenon known as asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Unfortunately, at the level of the organism, the relationship between symptomatic UTI and ASB is poorly defined, confounding our understanding of microbial pathogenesis and strategies for clinical management. Unlike diarrheagenic pathotypes of E. coli, the definition of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) remains phenomenologic, without conserved phenotypes and (known) genetic determinants that rigorously distinguish UTI- and ASB-associated strains. This manuscript provides a cross-disciplinary review of the current issues – from interrelated mechanistic and diagnostic perspectives – and describes new opportunities by which clinical resources can be leveraged to overcome molecular challenges. Specifically, we present our work harnessing a large collection of patient-derived isolates to identify features that do (and do not) distinguish UTI- from ASB-associated E. coli strains. Analyses of biofilm formation, previously reported to be higher in ASB strains, revealed extensive phenotypic heterogeneity that did not correlate with symptomatology. However, metabolomic experiments revealed distinct signatures between ASB and cystitis isolates, including species in the purine pathway (previously shown to be critical for intracellular survival during acute infection). Together, these studies demonstrate how large-scale, wild-type approaches can help dissect the physiology of colonization-versus-infection, suggesting that the molecular definition of UPEC may rest at the level of global bacterial metabolism.

Therefore, the abundance of lipid mediators, including endocannabinoids and oxylipins from cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent metabolism were profiled in the CL on days 4, 11, and 18 of the estrous cycle and on day 18 of pregnancy. The objectives of this study were to identify lipid mediators that regulate luteal function during these transitions, to integrate the lipid profile with a previously published mRNA profile of CL during maternal recognition of pregnancy, and to determine the effect of a subset of lipids on in vitro progesterone production.

To reveal the disease etiology, we generated stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes from HADHA-deficient hiPSCs and accelerated their maturation via a novel, engineered MicroRNA Maturation Cocktail (MiMaC) that upregulated the epigenetic regulator, HOPX. Fatty acid challenged MiMaC treated HADHA mutant cardiomyocytes manifested the disease phenotype: defective calcium dynamics and repolarization kinetics which resulted in a pro-arrhythmic state. Single cell RNA-seq revealed a novel cardiomyocyte developmental intermediate, based on metabolic gene expression. This intermediate gave rise to mature-like cardiomyocytes in control cells but, mutant cells transitioned to a pathological state with reduced fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO), reduced mitochondrial proton gradient, disrupted cristae structure and defective cardiolipin remodeling. This study reveals that TFPa/HADHA, a MLCL-AT-like enzyme, is required for FAO and cardiolipin remodeling, essential for functional mitochondria in human cardiomyocytes.

The study was suspended after the fifth dose (day 3) due to adverse gastrointestinal effects. Cecal and fecal samples were obtained before and after (Days days -52, -28, -14, 0, 7, 14, 28 and 52) metronidazole administration. DNA was extracted from the cecal and fecal samples, and 16S rRNA genes were sequenced. The bacterial diversity and composition of each sample was determined. Richness and evenness indices were significantly decreased by metronidazole administration in both cecal and fecal samples, but overall composition was only significantly changed in fecal samples on Day 3 (ANOSIM, p=0.008). The most dominant phyla were Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in all groups examined. In fecal samples, significant changes at the phyla Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes, Lentisphaerae and Verrucomicrobia occurred on Day 3, which correlated with clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease. Analysis of the predicted microbial functions using PICRUSt indicated changes associated with metronidazole in fecal samples. The metabolome was characterized by mass spectrometry-based methods. Fecal, but not cecal metabolites were affected by metronidazole. The fecal metabolites affected represented diverse metabolic pathways such as nucleic acid metabolism, secondary bile metabolism, fatty acid synthesis/degradation/elongation or metabolism and sugar metabolism.

Bariatric surgery is the primary method for treating these disorders. An alternative procedure, bile diversion, dysregulates the circulation of bile acids in order to minimize fatty acid absorption. It is recognized that bile acids are involved in multiple signaling cascades, however the downstream effects of their malabsorption are yet unknown. In order to investigate the effects this will have on the metabolome, an untargeted liquid chromatography-ion mobility-mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS) method was developed and optimized. We describe a fecal metabolite extraction method for separating species in multiple dimensions, comparing relative abundances across groups, and annotating compounds when possible. Utilizing our untargeted metabolomic pipeline, we were able to detect molecules with perturbed abundance values, including secondary bile acids, which contribute to differences between the experimental metabolomic profiles.

Methods: Survival of C57Bl/6 mice was monitored after lethal challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or cecal and ligation puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis and treated with Hz or saline. Mice were also challenged with LPS and treated with Hz for leukocyte counting, cytokine quantification and determination of metabolomic profiles in the peritoneal fluid. Results: Hz treatment improved survival outcomes after lethal challenge with LPS or CLPinduced sepsis. LPS challenge promoted acute neutrophil accumulation and production of interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) and IL-6 in the peritoneum, whereas Hz treatment suppressed neutrophil infiltration and cytokine production. We further characterized the metabolomic alterations caused by LPS challenge, which predicted activity of metabolic pathways related to fatty acids and eicosanoids. Hz treatment had a profound effect over the metabolic response, reflected by reductions of the relative levels of fatty acids. Conclusion: Collectively, these data demonstrate that Hz treatment is associated with metabolic reprogramming of pathways that sustain the inflammatory response.

Glucocorticoid steroids are current mainstay pharmacological regimen to decrease muscle inflammation and prolong the ambulatory period in these patients, but daily intake of glucocorticoids like prednisone and deflazacort causes adverse side effects like osteoporosis, adrenal suppression, insulin resistance and obesity. Intermittent steroid dosing has been proposed as alternative to maintain benefits and limit side effects, but a detailed understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the regimen-specific effects in muscle is still missing.

Currently available drugs are not well-suited to mass drug administration efforts, so new treatments are urgently required. One potential vulnerability is the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia—present in many filariae—which is vital to the worm. Genome scale metabolic networks have been used to study prokaryotes and protists and have proven valuable in identifying therapeutic targets, but only recently have been applied to eukaryotic organisms. Here, we present iDC625, the first compartmentalized metabolic model of a parasitic worm. We used this model to show how metabolic pathway usage allows the worm to adapt to different environments, and predict a set of 99 reactions essential to the survival of B. malayi. We validated three of those reactions with drug tests and demonstrated novel antifilarial properties for all three compounds.

This study is comparing the plasma metabolomics profile of patients with the genetic disorder, Wilson disease, compared to healthy subjects matched by age, sex, and BMI. Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic copper overload condition characterized by hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms with a pathogenesis not well-understood. Choline is essential for lipid metabolism and the methionine cycle; a dysregulated methionine cycle is reported in animal models of WD, though not verified in humans. Defects in neurotransmitters, acetylcholine, and biogenic amines are reported in WD patients with neurological presentations. Precursors of these neuromodulators include choline, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and histidine. Less is known about the circulating levels of these precursors in WD.

In this work, gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed for the determination of signatures found in ER+/PR+ breast cancer cells derived from MCF-7 using different extraction solvents including: A, formic acid in water; B, ammonium hydroxide in water; C, ethyl acetate; D, methanol: water (1:1, v/v); and E, acetonitrile: water (1:1, v/v). The greatest extraction rate and diversity of metabolites occurs with extraction solvents A and E. Extraction solvent D showed moderate extraction efficiency, whereas extraction solvent B and C showed inferior metabolite diversity. Metabolite set enrichment analysis results showed energy production pathways to be key in MCF-7 cell lines. This study showed that mass spectrometry could identify key metabolites associated with cancers. The highest enriched pathways were related to energy production as well as Warburg effect pathways, which may shed light on how energy metabolism has been hijacked to encourage tumour progression and eventually metastasis in breast cancer.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000851	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8PH4S			Metabolomic Profiles of Pancreatic ?-Cells and Islets Exposed to Arsenic	Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disorder that affects hundreds of millions of people world-wide and is a growing public health concern. Despite recent advances in T2D research, the etiology of this disease and the mechanisms underlying the metabolic defects remain poorly understood. While obesity is thought to be the main cause for the rising prevalence of T2D, obesity alone cannot explain differences in the trends of T2D among different geographical regions and populations. Growing evidence suggests that environmental exposures to toxic and diabetogenic substances must play important roles. Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a naturally occurring toxic metalloid. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are exposed to unsafe levels of iAs in drinking water and food. iAs is a potent carcinogen, but iAs exposure has also been linked to increase risk of T2D. While the link between iAs exposure and T2D is well-established, the mechanisms underlying the diabetogenic effects of iAs exposure remain unclear. Results of our previously published and ongoing studies suggest that pancreatic ß-cells are a primary target for iAs and its metabolites and that impaired insulin secretion by ß-cells is the mechanism by which iAs exposure leads to diabetes. The proposed project will use metabolomics to identify metabolic pathways in ß-cells and pancreatic islets that are targeted by iAs and its metabolites, monomethyl-As (MAs) and dimethyl-As (DMAs). The metabolomics data combined with results of our ongoing mechanistic studies will provide a comprehensive picture of the metabolic dysfunction leading to the development of diabetes in individuals exposed to iAs and of the molecular mechanisms that underlie this dysfunction. Identifying the affected pathways and mechanisms will ultimately help to improve strategies for prevention and/or treatment of T2D associated with chronic exposure to iAs.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000853	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8F108			Integrating microbiome and metabolome data to annotate metabolite origins	Untargeted metabolomics of host-associated samples has yielded insights into mechanisms by which microbes modulate health. However, data interpretation is challenged by the complexity of origins of the small molecules measured, which can come from the host, microbes that live within the host, or from other exposures such as diet or the environment. We address this challenge through development of AMON: Annotation of Metabolite Origins via Networks. AMON is an open-source bioinformatics application that can be used to annotate which compounds in the metabolome could have been produced by bacteria present or the host, to evaluate pathway enrichment of host verses microbial metabolites, and to visualize which compounds may have been produced by host versus microbial enzymes in KEGG pathway maps.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000854	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8998T			Exosomal lipids for classifying early and late stage non-small cell lung cancer	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Patients with early stage lung cancer have the best prognosis with surgical removal of the tumor, but the disease is often asymptomatic until advanced disease develops, and there are no effective blood-based screening methods for early detection of lung cancer in at-risk populations. We have explored the lipid profiles of blood plasma exosomes using ultra high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry (UHR-FTMS) for early detection of the prevalent non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Exosomes are nanovehicles released by various cells and tumor tissues to elicit important biofunctions such as immune modulation and tumor development. Plasma exosomal lipid profiles were acquired from 39 normal and 91 NSCLC subjects (44 early stage and 47 late stage). We have applied two multivariate statistical methods, Random Forest (RF) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to classify the data. For the RF method, the Gini importance of the assigned lipids was calculated to select 16 lipids with top importance. Using the LASSO method, 7 features were selected based on a grouped LASSO penalty. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for early and late stage cancer versus normal subjects using the selected lipid features was 0.85 and 0.88 for RF and 0.79 and 0.77 for LASSO, respectively. These results show the value of RF and LASSO for metabolomics data-based biomarker development, which provide robust an independent classifiers with sparse data sets. Application of LASSO and Random Forests identifies lipid features that successfully distinguish early stage lung cancer patient from healthy individuals.

These fractions were generated through established differential centrifugation techniques and lipid extraction. Developmental time points were chosen based upon our understanding of brain development in the murine model. In mice cortex, E18 is characterized by extension or elongation of axons toward targets, while around P0-P3 is when axons start innervating targets and branching occurs. At P6-P7 is when target innervation is generally complete and a subpopulation of cortical neurons undergo developmental cell death. By P9 growth cones have mostly disappeared.

Applying quantitative transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to a panel of isogenic K13 mutant or wild-type P. falciparum lines, we observe that K13 mutations reprogram multiple aspects of intra-erythrocytic parasite biology. These changes impact its cell cycle periodicity, the unfolded protein response and protein degradation, vesicular trafficking and endocytosis, and mitochondrial functions including the TCA cycle, the electron transport chain, and redox regulation. Ring-stage artemisinin resistance mediated by the K13 R539T mutation was neutralized using atovaquone, an electron transport chain inhibitor. Our data suggest that modification of mitochondrial physiology, accompanied by other processes to reduce artemisinin’s proteotoxic effects, help protect parasites against this pro-oxidant drug, allowing resumption of growth once the rapidly-cleared artemisinins have reached sub-therapeutic levels.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the brain as well as degeneration of motor and non-motor circuitry. The cause of neuronal death is currently unknown, although chronic neuroinflammation, aggregated a-synuclein, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have all been implicated. Gliosis has been shown to exacerbate neuroinflammation via secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and there is a subsequent infiltration of T lymphocytes (T-cells), into the brain of PD patients. Using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), we have observed metabolomic changes in stool samples, thought to be associated with the potential disease-modifying effect of an immunotherapy administered to transgenic Parkinsonian (A53T) mice. Significant elevations (p<0.05) in metabolites associated with immune response (taurine, histamine and its methylated product, 3-methylhistamine) are identified as being higher in the mice undergoing immunotherapy. Furthermore, a reduction in triacylglycerols (TG) and diacylglyceols (DG) expression in stool following immunotherapy suggests a regulation of lipid breakdown or biosynthesis with the vaccine. These “omics” markers (among others reported in this article) along with weight gain and increased life expectancy suggest that the immunotherapy is positively modifying the disease state.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000868	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8GT28			Lipid composition of isolated lipid droplets from the functional bovine corpus luteum	Establishment and maintenance of pregnancy is dependent on progesterone synthesized by the corpus luteum (CL). The CL is known for the prominent presence of intracellular lipid droplets (LDs). However relatively little is known about the composition and function of these luteal LDs. Our objective was to identify the lipid composition of LDs from fully functional bovine CLs. Luteal LDs were isolated by flotation through a discontinuous sucrose gradient, lipids were then extracted using a standard Bligh and Dyer protocol, dried, and sent to Avanti Polar Lipids for lipidomics analysis. The samples were provided for lipidomic profiling of free sterols, cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, diacylglycerols, phospholipids, and sphingolipids. Molecular species were resolved by reversed-phase liquid chromatography in the presence of class and sub-class specific internal standard compounds added to each sample. The compounds were detected by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) for mass-specific fragment ions according to the lipid class and molecular weight of the compound. Quantification of cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, and diglycerides were directly calculated with standards and internal standards from calibration response curves. The remaining lipid species were semi-quantization using the integrated area of each analyte’s MRM peak, divided by the appropriate internal standard peak area, and multiplied by the standard’s known concentration. Lipid concentrations were normalized to the corresponding protein concentration of each sample and as a mol % relative to total lipids or within each lipid class. Isolated luteal LDs were composed primarily of triglyceride (88%, mol% of lipid class to total lipids). Other neutral lipids included diacylglycerol, 2.9%; and cholesteryl esters, 1.5%. Polar lipids were primarily composed of phosphatidylcholine (3.1%), sphingomyelin (1.5%), phosphatidylinositol (0.9%), phosphatidylethanolamine (0.8%) and phosphatidylserine (0.4%). A number of other minor lipids representing less than 0.32% of the total lipid pool were also detected including phosphatidylglycerol, lysophospholipids, ceramides, and glycosylated ceramides. Lipid composition of bovine luteal LDs are distinct from LDs isolated from other tissues and in other species.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000870	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8796F			Subcellular organelle lipidomics in TLR-4-activated macrophages	Lipids orchestrate biological processes by acting remotely as signaling molecules or locally as membrane components that modulate protein function. Detailed insight into lipid function requires knowledge of the subcellular localization of individual lipids. We report an analysis of the subcellular lipidome of the mammalian macrophage, a cell type that plays key roles in inflammation, immune responses, and phagocytosis. Nuclei, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), plasmalemma, and cytoplasm were isolated from RAW 264.7 macrophages in basal and activated states. Subsequent lipidomic analyses of major membrane lipid categories identified 229 individual/isobaric species, including 163 glycerophospholipids, 48 sphingolipids, 13 sterols, and 5 prenols. Major subcellular compartments exhibited substantially divergent glycerophospholipid profiles. Activation of macrophages by the Toll-like receptor 4-specific lipopolysaccharide Kdo2-lipid A caused significant remodeling of the subcellular lipidome. Some changes in lipid composition occurred in all compartments (e.g. increases in the levels of ceramides and the cholesterol precursors desmosterol and lanosterol). Other changes were manifest in specific organelles. For example, oxidized sterols increased and unsaturated cardiolipins decreased in mitochondria, whereas unsaturated ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamines decreased in the ER. We speculate that these changes may reflect mitochondrial oxidative stress and the release of arachidonic acid from the ER in response to cell activation.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000871	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M83M5X			Regulated accumulation of desmosterol integrates macrophage lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses	Inflammation and macrophage foam cells are characteristic features of atherosclerotic lesions, but the mechanisms linking cholesterol accumulation to inflammation and LXR-dependent response pathways are poorly understood. To investigate this relationship, we utilized lipidomic and transcriptomic methods to evaluate the effect of diet and LDL receptor genotype on macrophage foam cell formation within the peritoneal cavities of mice. Foam cell formation was associated with significant changes in hundreds of lipid species and unexpected suppression, rather than activation, of inflammatory gene expression. We provide evidence that regulated accumulation of desmosterol underlies many of the homeostatic responses observed in macrophage foam cells, including activation of LXR target genes, inhibition of SREBP target genes, selective reprogramming of fatty acid metabolism and suppression of inflammatory response genes. These observations suggest that macrophage activation in atherosclerotic lesions results from extrinsic, pro-inflammatory signals generated within the artery wall that suppress homeostatic and anti-inflammatory functions of desmosterol.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000872	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8ZT30			Lipidome Signatures of Metastasis in a Transgenic Mouse Model of Sonic Hedgehog Medulloblastoma.	Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, has high propensity to metastasize. Currently, the standard treatment for MB patients includes radiation therapy administered to the entire brain and spine for the purpose of treating or preventing against metastasis. Due to this aggressive treatment, the majority of long-term survivors will be left with permanent and debilitating neurocognitive impairments and, for the 30-40% patients that fail to respond to radiation, all will relapse with terminal metastatic disease. An understanding of the underlying biology that drives MB metastasis is lacking, and is critically needed in order to develop targeted therapeutics for its prevention. To examine the metastatic biology of sonic hedgehog (SHH) MB, the human MB subgroup with the worst clinical outcome, we first generated a robust SmoA1-Math-GFP mouse model that reliably reproduces human SHH MB whereby metastases can be visualized under fluorescence microscopy. Lipidome alterations associated with metastasis were then investigated by applying Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS) under both positive and negative ionization modes to primary tumor samples collected from mice with (n=18) and without (n=7) metastasis. This study provides the first insights into dysregulations of lipid metabolism associated with SHH MB metastatic progression, and thus serves as a guide toward novel targeted therapies.

While this pathogen has been well-characterized from morphological and genetic perspectives, little is known the secondary metabolites it produces and their role in pathogenicity. We used an untargeted LC-MS/MS-based approach paired with global natural products social molecular networking (GNPS) to compare the metabolite profiles of virulent and avirulent Ilyonectria strains. The ethyl acetate liquid culture extracts of 22 I. mors-panacis strains and closely related species were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Principal component analysis of LC-MS features resulted in two distinct groups, which corresponded to virulent and avirulent Ilyonectria strains. Virulent strains produced more types of compounds than the avirulent strains. The previously reported I. mors-panacis antifungal compound radicicol was present. Additionally, a number of related resorcyclic acid lactones (RALs) were putatively identified, namely pochonins and several additional derivatives of radicicol. Pochonins have not been previously reported in Ilyonectria spp. and have documented antimicrobial activity. This research contributes to our understanding of I. mors-panacis natural products and its pathogenic relationship with ginseng.

In filberts (Corylus sp.), chelated iron promotes the growth of new shoots but the mechanism(s) are not understood. Objectives: To use untargeted metabolomics and hormonomics approaches to generate novel hypotheses for the morphoregulatory role of ferric ethylenediamine-N,N'-di-(ortho-hydroxyphenyl) acetic acid (Fe-EDDHA) in filbert shoot organogenesis in vitro. Methods: Data were generated using previously optimized standardized untargeted metabolomics protocols with time of flight mass spectrometry. Multivariate statistical tools (principal component and partial least squares discriminant analysis) did not detect significant differences. Discovery tools Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), multiple linear regression analysis, Bayesian analysis, logical algorithms, machine learning, synthetic biotransformations, targeted hormonomics, and online resources including MetaboAnalyst were used. Results: Starch/sucrose metabolism and shikimate pathway metabolites were increased. Dose dependent decreases were found in polyphenol metabolism, specifically ellagic acid and its methylated derivative 3,4,3'-tri-O-methylellagic acid. Hormonomics analysis revealed significant differences in phytohormones and their conjugates. FeEDDHA treatment reduced indole-3-acetic acid, abscisic acid, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid conjugates (JA-Trp, JA-Ile, OH-JA) and dihydrozeatinglucoside in regenerating explants. Serotonin (5HT) was decreased in FeEDDHA-treated regenerating tissues while the related metabolite melatonin was increased. Eight phenolic conjugates of 5HT and eight catabolites were affected by FeEDDHA indicating that metabolism to sequester, deactivate and metabolize 5HT was induced by Fe(III). Tryptophan was metabolized through kynurenine but not anthranilate. Conclusion: Seven novel hypotheses were generated to guide future studies to understand the regulatory control(s) of shoot organogenesis.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000880	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8XX1Z			Metatranscriptomic Analysis of the Mouse Gut Microbiome Response to the Persistent Organic Pollutant 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzofuran	Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are important environmental chemicals and continued study of their mechanism of action remains a high priority. POPs, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are widespread environmental contaminants that are agonists for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Activation of the AHR modulates the gut microbiome community structure and function, host immunity, and the host metabolome. In the current study, male C57BL6/J mice were exposed, via the diet, to 5 ug/kg body weight (BW) TCDF or 24 ug/kg BW of TCDF every day for 5 days. The functional and structural changes imparted by TCDF exposure to the gut microbiome and host metabolome were explored via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metabolomics, and bacterial metatranscriptomics. Significant changes included increases in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis gene expression after exposure to 24 ug/kg BW of TCDF. Increases in LPS biosynthesis were confirmed with metabolomics and LPS assays using serum obtained from TCDF-treated mice. Significant increases in gene expression within aspartate and glutamate metabolism were noted after exposure to 24 ug/kg BW of TCDF. Together, these results suggest that after exposure to 24 ug/kg BW of TCDF, the gut microbiome increases the production of LPS and glutamate to promote localized gut inflammation, potentially using glutamate as a stress response.

TGFß3 may play an antifibrotic role at the renal level, counteracting the role of TGFß1, using a mouse model heterozygous for the TGFß3 gene (TGFß3+/-). Partial deletion of TGFß3 causes in the mice albuminuria, loss of glomerular filtration rate, accelerated fibrosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and increment of glomerular basement membrane thickening.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000885	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8938R			Multi-omics analysis delineates the distinct functions of sub-cellular acetyl-CoA pools in Toxoplasma gondii	Acetyl-CoA is a key metabolite in all organisms, implicated in transcriptional regulation, post-translational modification as well as fuelling the TCA-cycle and the synthesis and elongation of fatty acids (FAs). The obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii possesses two enzymes which produce acetyl-CoA in the cytosol and nucleus: acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) and ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), while the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase-complex (BCKDH) generates acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. To obtain a global and integrative picture of the role of distinct sub-cellular acetyl-CoA pools, we measured the acetylome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of parasites lacking ACL/ACS or BCKDH. Loss of ACL/ACS results in the hypo-acetylation of nucleo-cytosolic and secretory proteins, alters gene expression broadly and is required for the synthesis of parasite-specific FAs. In contrast, loss of BCKDH causes few specific changes in the acetylome, transcriptome and proteome which allow these parasites to rewire their metabolism to adapt to the obstruction of the TCA-cycle.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000887	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M81M59			Biomolecular analyses of hypospadias according to severity	Hypospadias, characterized by the displacement of the opening of the urethra at any point in the medial-ventral side of the penis, is classified upon severity as mild (Type I) and severe (Type II and Type III) hypospadias. Hypospadias’ etiology is idiopathic in the majority of cases, and underlying causes seem of multifactorial origin. Studies regarding genetic variants support this notion. It is unknown whether downstream gene products fit this profile. This study evaluated the metabolome of hypospadias by using the emerging technology of metabolomics in the search for distinct cellular processes associated with hypospadias’ etiology according to the severity of this congenital urogenital condition. Foreskin samples were collected during urethroplasty from boys with Type I, II, and III hypospadias or undergoing elective circumcision (N=28) between 5 to 28 months of age. Samples were processed and submitted to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). MetaboloAnalyst (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/) online platform was used for bioinformatic analyses. The metabolome of Type II and Type III hypospadias patients differs from the metabolome of Type I hypospadias and control patients. Thirty-five metabolites were identified by GC/MS. Of those, 14 metabolites, amino acids, were found in significantly low concentrations in Type II and Type III hypospadias in comparison to Type I hypospadias and controls. Amino acids comprised asparagine, aspartate, glutamate, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, and tyrosine. The difference observed in the metabolome between severe and mild hypospadias supports previous research work of plausible severity-dependent etiologies for hypospadias. The observed downregulation of specific amino acids in severe hypospadias provides alternative routes for future research aiming to identify disrupted networks and pathways while considering the severity of hypospadias.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000889	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8S39G			1H NMR metabolomics confirms serine hydroxymethyltransferase is the primary target of 2-aminoacrylate in a ridA mutant of Salmonella enterica	The reactive intermediate deaminase RidA (EC: 3.5.99.10) is conserved across all domains of life and deaminates reactive enamine species. When S. enterica ridA mutants are grown in minimal medium, 2-aminoacrylate (2AA) accumulates, damages several pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)- dependent enzymes, and elicits an observable growth defect. Genetic studies suggested that damage to serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GlyA), and the resultant depletion of 5,10-methelenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-mTHF), was responsible for the observed growth defect. However, the downstream metabolic consequence from GlyA damage by 2AA remains relatively unexplored. This study sought to use untargeted 1H NMR metabolomics to determine whether the metabolic state of a S. enterica ridA mutant was accurately reflected by characterizing growth phenotypes. The data supported the conclusion that metabolic changes in a ridA mutant were due to the IlvA-dependent generation of 2AA, and that the majority of these changes were a consequence of damage to GlyA. While many of the shifts in the metabolome of a ridA mutant could be explained, changes in some metabolites were not easily modeled, suggesting that additional levels of metabolic complexity remain to be unraveled.

To understand how BPA and the reputedly more inert bisphenol S (BPS) affect the placenta, C57BL6J mouse dams were fed 200 µg/kg body weight BPA or BPS daily for 2 wk and then bred. They continued to receive these chemicals until embryonic day 12.5, whereupon placental samples were collected and compared with unexposed controls. BPA and BPS altered the expression of an identical set of 13 genes. Both exposures led to a decrease in the area occupied by spongiotrophoblast relative to multinucleated giant cells (GCs) within the junctional zone, markedly reduced placental serotonin (5-HT) concentrations, and lowered 5-HT GC immunoreactivity. Concentrations of dopamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, the main metabolite of serotonin, were increased. GC dopamine immunoreactivity was increased in BPA- and BPS-exposed placentas. A strong positive correlation between 5-HT+ GCs and reductions in spongiotrophoblast to GC area suggests that this neurotransmitter is essential for maintaining cells within the junctional zone. In contrast, an inverse correlation existed between dopamine+ GCs and reductions spongiotrophoblast to GC area. These outcomes lead to the following conclusions. First, BPS exposure causes almost identical placental effects as BPA. Second, a major target of BPA/BPS is either spongiotrophoblast or GC within the junctional zone. Third, imbalances in neurotransmitter-positive GC and an observed decrease in docosahexaenoic acid and estradiol, also occurring in response to BPA/BPS exposure, likely affect the placental–brain axis of the developing mouse fetus.

Here, we show that azithromycin—a clinically used macrolide antibiotic that targets the bacterium-like ribosome of the malaria parasites apicoplast organelle and causes a slow-killing ‘delayed death’ phenotype—can also rapidly kill parasites throughout the asexual blood-stages of the lifecycle via a ‘quick-killing’ mechanism of action. Investigation of 84 azithromycin analogues revealed nanomolar quick-killing potency that is directed against the very earliest stage of parasite development within red blood cells. Indeed, the best analogue exhibited 1600-fold higher potency than azithromycin for in vitro treatment windows less than 48 hours. Analogues were also effective against the zoonotic malaria parasite P. knowlesi, and against both multi-drug and artemisinin resistant P. falciparum lines. Metabolomic profiles of azithromycin analogue treated parasites were similar to those of chloroquine treated parasites, suggesting that the quick-killing mechanism of action may in part be localised to the parasite food vacuole. However, metabolomic signatures associated with mitochondrial disruption were also present. In addition, unlike chloroquine, azithromycin and analogues were active across blood stage development, including merozoite invasion, suggesting that these macrolides have a multi-factorial mechanism of quick-killing activity. The positioning of functional groups added to azithromycin and its quick-killing analogues altered their activity against bacterial-like ribosomes but had minimal change on quick-killing activity, which suggests that apicoplast-targeting, delayed-death activity can either be preserved or removed independently of quick-killing. Apicoplast minus parasites remained susceptible to both azithromycin and its analogues, further demonstrating that quick-killing is independent of apicoplast-targeting, delayed-death activity. Therefore, development of azithromycin and analogues as antimalarials offers the possibility of targeting parasites through both a quick-killing and delayed death mechanism of action in a single, multifactorial chemotype.

These children with asthma experience high morbidity and our preliminary research finds significant effects of ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter and ammonia. Yet children spend the majority of their time indoors. Studies conducted in urban settings demonstrate that indoor particulate matter (PM) influences asthma outcomes and HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) cleaners can reduce indoor and ambient generated PM. Data on asthma in rural settings is sparse and trials incorporating HEPA portable air cleaners are lacking. This study seeks to characterize key indoor pollutant exposures for 80 children with asthma who reside within 400 meters of crop production or dairy operations. Prioritizing methods with low participant burden as well as innovative approaches, we will evaluate the effectiveness of the enhanced intervention on 1) Reducing indoor measures of PM and NH3 across seasons, 2. Improving clinically relevant measures of asthma health (Asthma Control Test, lung function, self-reported symptom days, oral steroid treatment, unscheduled clinical utilization), and 3. Reducing biomarkers of inflammation - urinary cysteine leukotriene (uLTE4) and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO). Caregiver psychosocial stress and behavioral components will be evaluated as mediators of these effects. The study design, procedures, translation of research results for multiple stakeholders and development of an environmental action plan to control/eliminate exposures are conducted within El Proyecto Bienestar, a longstanding UW-community research to action partnership. The project incorporates each of the NIEHS 2012-17 strategic themes and directly addresses 7 of the 11 sub goals.

Here we report that mutation of Axin1, a tumor-suppressor part of the ß-catenin destruction complex, results in the activation of macropinocytosis in Alexander hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Axin1 binds Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3), and we found that inhibition of GSK3 by Lithium chloride (LiCl), CHIR99021 or dominant-negative GSK3 triggered macropinocytosis. GSK3 inhibition caused a rapid increase in endolysosomes that was independent of new protein synthesis. GSK3 inhibition or Axin1 mutation increased lysosomal activity, which could be followed with tracers for active cathepsin D, ß-glucosidase, and ovalbumin degradation. Microinjection of LiCl into the blastula cavity of Xenopus embryos caused a striking increase in dextran macropinocytosis. The effects of GSK3 inhibition on macropinocytosis and protein degradation in endolysosomes were blocked by the macropinocytosis inhibitors EIPA or IPA-2, suggesting that the increased membrane trafficking drives lysosomal activity and nutrient acquisition.

These compounds were identified through a high throughput screening designed for that purpose. During that screening, we screened 43,783 compounds and identified 367 primary hits. These 367 hits were further retested using a 8-point dilution series (from 0.25 to 30 uM) and verified the activity of 250 compounds that induce the hyper lipid accumulating phenotype in algae. Once the hit compounds were identified and confirmed, we then performed extensive chemoinformatics analysis to look for common scaffolds and identified several common substructures. We then selected 15 top performing compounds from 5 diverse structural groups and tested biochemical parameters such as growth, lipid accumulating capacity, effect on photosynthetic rates, respiration rates, oxygen consumption rates, analysis of different lipid species to quantify and identify fatty acid species using GC-MS. To understand the global changes in the lipidome, 2 structurally similar compounds were selected and compared with cells grown without compounds as control for untargeted lipidome analysis.

In spite of large-scale attempts, there remains an unmet need to uncover molecular determinants of BRAFi insensitivity and devise actionable combination targets to overcome resistance. Here, using an integrative approach of experimentation, and mathematical flux balance analyses in a panel of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells, we show that elevated antioxidant capacity of melanoma cells is linked to their drug sensitivity. Specifically, we report that drug-insensitive melanoma cells can maintain higher levels of antioxidant metabolites to withstand the lethal effects of drugs. By extending our analysis to other melanoma subtypes in the TCGA, we show that elevated redox capacity could indeed be a general feature of melanoma. Our results suggest that redox vulnerabilities could be exploited for therapeutic benefits and identify unsuspected combination targets to enhance the effects of BRAFi in pan-melanoma.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) metabolomics is a quantitative and reproducible method for the determination of bacterial response to environmental stressors and for visualization of perturbations to biochemical pathways. NMR metabolomics is used to elucidate metabolite differences between wild type and antimicrobially mutated Escherichia coli (E. coli) samples. Proton (1H) NMR hydrophilic metabolite analysis was conducted on samples of E. coli after 33 growth cycles of a minimum inhibitory challenge to E. coli by poly(amidoamine) dendrimers functionalized with mannose and with C16-DABCO quaternary ammonium endgroups and compared to the metabolic profile of wild type E. coli. The wild type and mutated E. coli samples were separated into distinct sample sets by hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA) and sparse partial least squares discriminate analysis (sPLS-DA). Metabolite components of membrane fortification and energy related pathways had a significant p-value and fold change between the wild type and mutated E. coli. Amino acids commonly associated with membrane fortification from cationic antimicrobials, such as lysine, were found to have a higher concentration in the mutated E. coli than the wild type E. coli. N-acetylglucosamine, a major component of peptidoglycan synthesis, was found to have a 25 fold higher concentration in the mid log phase of the mutated E. coli than the mid log phase of the wild type. The metabolic profile suggests that E. coli change their peptidoglycan composition in order to garner protection from the highly positively charged and multivalent C16 DABCO and mannose functionalized dendrimer.

Metabolites are the direct product of metabolic activity; they are therefore expected to both reflect and influence the daily cycle of the microbial community. Here we measure the intracellular metabolome of the microbial community of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, sampled at 4-hour intervals for 8 days. Concentrations of some metabolites common to many organisms exhibit diel periodicity, revealing synchrony of community-level metabolism. Comparing these data to gene expression data reveals temporal offsets between gene transcription and cellular activity, and ties some metabolites to the activities of specific organisms. For example, the dramatic fluctuations of the disaccharide trehalose likely reflect the daily cycles of Crocosphaera, a photosynthesizing cyanobacteria that needs to store energy during the day to fuel nighttime nitrogen-fixation. This study illustrates how pairing multiple types of 'omics and environmental data can provide insight into how the activities of individual organisms lead to community functions such as net primary productivity and nitrogen fixation.

Here, we utilise a large human heart biobank of carefully procured, cryopreserved left ventricular myocardium to obtain direct molecular insights into ischaemic (ICM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the most common causes of HF worldwide. We performed unbiased, deep proteomic and metabolomic analyses of 51 left ventricular (LV) samples from 44 cryopreserved human ICM and DCM hearts, including age-matched, histopathologically normal, donor controls of both genders for comparison. For the first time, we report perturbed thyroid hormone signalling pathways in the myocardium of both types of HF, and unveil the interaction of gender with HF, including increased nitric oxide-related arginine metabolism in male hearts, and many gender-specific mitochondrial and X chromosome-linked protein and metabolite changes. We provide all raw data, in addition to an interactive online application, as a publicly-available resource.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000932	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8710D			California mouse fecal metabolite analysis	Xenoestrogens are found in plant products, such as genistein (GEN), or industrial chemicals, such as bisphenol A (BPA), present in consumer products that are also pervasive in the environment. Early exposure to such endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) may affect neural development by inducing direct neural effects and/or through the microbiome-gut-brain axis. To test this hypothesis, California mice (Peromyscus californicus) offspring were exposed through the maternal diet to GEN (250 mg/kg feed weight) or BPA (5 mg/kg feed weight, low dose- LD and 50 mg/kg, upper dose-UD), and dams were placed on these diets two weeks prior to breeding, throughout gestation, and lactation. Various behaviors, gut microbiome, and fecal metabolome were assessed starting at 90 days of age. The LD but not UD of BPA resulted in individuals spending more time engaging in repetitive behaviors. GEN exposed individuals were more likely to exhibit such behaviors and showed socio-communicative disturbances. BPA and GEN exposed females had increased number of metabolites involved in carbohydrate metabolism and synthesis.. Males exposed to BPA or GEN showed alterations in lysine degradation and phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism. Current findingsindicate cause for concern that developmental exposure to BPA or GEN might affect the microbiome-gut-brain axis.

Given that antibiotics have diverse pharmacokinetic and antibacterial properties, investigating the type, concentration and location would help us understand what microbes encounter at an infection site. Here, we developed Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) methods to detect 18 antibiotics in clinical samples using cystic fibrosis sputum as an application. Three liquid extraction methods were compared with spike-in controls of antibiotics on the Waters Acquity Quattro Premier XE. Extraction with dithiothreitol captured the most antibiotics and was then used to detect antibiotics in sputum samples from 11 people with cystic fibrosis in comparison to self-reported antibiotic use. For the sputum samples, the Quattro Premier XE method detected nanomolar or micromolar concentrations of 16 antibiotics. In 71 of the 158 sputum samples, at least one antibiotic that was not reported by the subject was detected by the LC-MS method, a discordance largely explained by alternating usage and the long half-life of azithromycin. For ~37% of samples, antibiotics were marked by the subject but were not detected, which has implications for in vivo antibiotic penetrance and efficacy. Our study takes the first step in detecting antibiotics at the infection site, with future goals of incorporating accurate antibiotic data into microbiome studies.

They lead to food spoilage and also produce several classes of secondary metabolites that contaminate the food production chain. From a food safety perspective, the major challenge with assessing the risk of Alternaria contamination is the lack of a clear consensus on their species-level taxonomy. Furthermore, there are currently no reliable DNA sequencing methods to allow for differentiation of the toxigenic potential of these fungi. To address these issues, we performed metabolomic profiling using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) on 131 Canadian strains of Alternaria to determine their chemotaxonomy. The Alternaria strains were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and unbiased k-means clustering to identify metabolites with significant differences (P < 0.001) between groups. Four populations or ‘chemotypes’ were identified within the strains studied and several known secondary metabolites of Alternaria were identified as distinguishing metabolites.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000938	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8FM4N			Patterns in metabolite pools show that phytoplankton leave a taxon-specific signature on particulate carbon: North Pacific Subtropical Gyre depth profile	In the surface ocean, carbon is fixed by phytoplankton and respired by the entire marine community at an astonishingly high rate. At any point in time, the difference between these two processes yields a carbon pool in surface particles that is a combination of both freshly fixed and partially degraded material. On a molecular level, we have a limited knowledge of the small molecules, or metabolites, within this pool. Specific metabolites have been shown to be responsible for fueling respiration, maintaining organismal interactions, and transferring energy throughout the microbial community. Metabolomics, or the direct observation and quantification of the small molecules that are the result of cellular activity, provides an important lens through which we can begin to assess the standing stocks of small compounds that likely fuel a great deal of heterotrophic activity in the surface ocean. Here we describe community metabolomes of particulate material into the North Pacific Ocean and compare the metabolomes to a variety of phytoplankton grown in the lab. Using both targeted and untargeted metabolomics, we identify metabolites in the particulate carbon pool and explore their latitudinal and phylogenetic distributions. This analysis reveals several compounds that have not been previously recognized as abundant components of the marine organic carbon pool. We found that the community metabolome showed distinct differences between the regimes that likely reflects the phytoplankton community present. The community metabolome in surface waters of the subtropical domain was remarkably consistent even when sampled weeks apart, while the northern regions showed a patchier and less reproducible community metabolome. Some individual compounds showed distinct patterns between oceanographic regimes, including homarine, an abundant molecule that can contribute up to 4% of the total particulate carbon pool in marine surface waters. Glutamic acid and glutamine showed opposite patterns in the oceanographic regimes, suggesting differences in community-level nitrogen assimilation in these different regimes. Overall, this study offers a new perspective into particulate carbon composition in oceanographic research, reveals important carbon pools that may fuel the microbial loop, and suggests an altered community-level nitrogen assimilation capacity over the North Pacific transition zone.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000939	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M89T1B			Targeting Sirt2 reprograms T cell metabolism for effective immune response	There is a growing evidence that metabolism is a key driver of T cell functions. A switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of T cell activation and is required to meet metabolic demands of proliferation and effector functions. However the mechanisms underlying the metabolic switch in T cells remain unclear. Here we identify Sirt2 as a crucial immune checkpoint coordinating metabolic and functional fitness of T cells. Sirt2 is induced upon T cells activation and increases in late maturation stages. Sirt2 negatively regulates glycolysis by targeting key glycolytic enzymes. Remarkably, Sirt2 knockout T cells exhibit profound upregulation of aerobic glycolysis with enhanced proliferation and effector function and thus effectively reject tumor challenge in vivo. Furthermore pharmacologic inhibition of Sirt2 in human tumor infiltrating lymphocytes demonstrated similar phenotype. Taken together our results demonstrate Sirt2 as an actionable target to reprogram T cell metabolism to augment immunotherapy.

Objectives To evaluate the performances of different untargeted metabolomics methods on fruit juices metabolomics and authentication, orange and apple fruit juices were selected for this study. Methods IDA-MS and SWATH-MS based on UHPLC-QTOF were used for the metabolomics and authenticity determination of apple and orange juices, including the lab-made samples of oranges (Citrus sinensis Osb.) from Jiangxi Province, apples (Malus domestica Borkh) from Shandong Province, and different brands of commercial orange and apple juice samples from markets. Results IDA-MS and SWATH-MS could both acquire numerous MS1 features and MS2 information of juice components, while SWATH-MS excels at the acquisition rate of MS2. Distinctive separation between authentic orange juice and not authentic orange juice could be seen from principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis based on both IDA-MS and SWATH-MS. After analysis of variance, fold change analysis and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant mode, 53 and 46 potential markers were defined by IDA-MS and SWATH-MS (with 77.4% and 100% MS2 acquisition rate) separately. Subsequently, these potential markers were putatively annotated using general chemical databases with 6 more annotated by SWATH-MS. Furthermore, 7 of the potential markers, l-asparagine, umbelliferone, glucosamine, phlorin, epicatechin, phytosphingosine and chlorogenic acid, were identified with standards. For the consideration of model simplicity, two determined makers (umbelliferone and chlorogenic acid) were selected to construct the DD-SIMCA model in commercial samples because of their good correlation with apple adulteration proportion, and the sensitivity and specificity of the model were 100% and 95%. Conclusion SWATH-MS excels at the MS2 acquisition of juice components and potential markers. This study provides an overall performance comparison between IDA-MS and SWATH-MS, and guidance for the method selection on fruit juice metabolomics and juice authenticity determination. Two of the potential markers determined, umbelliferone and chlorogenic acid, could be used as apple juice indicators in orange juice.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000941	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8296W			A redox-active switch in Fructosamine-3-kinases expands the regulatory repertoire of the protein kinase super-family	Aberrant regulation of metabolic kinases by altered redox homeostasis is a major contributing factor in aging and disease such as diabetes. However, the biochemical mechanisms by which metabolic kinases are regulated under oxidative stress is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the catalytic activity of a conserved family of Fructosamine-3-kinases (FN3Ks), which are evolutionarily related to eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs), are regulated by redox-active cysteines in the kinase domain. By solving the crystal structure of FN3K homolog from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtFN3K), we demonstrate that it forms an unexpected strand-exchange dimer in which the ATP binding P-loop and adjoining beta strands are swapped between two chains in the dimer. This dimeric configuration is characterized by strained inter-chain disulfide bonds that stabilize the P-loop in an extended conformation. Mutational analysis and solution studies confirm that the strained disulfides function as redox “switches” to reversibly regulate FN3K activity and dimerization. Consistently, we find that human FN3K, which contains an equivalent P-loop Cys, is also redox-sensitive, whereas ancestral bacterial FN3K homologs, which lack a P-loop Cys, are not. Furthermore, CRISPR knockout of FN3K in human HepG2 cells results in significant upregulation of redox metabolites including glutathione. We propose that redox regulation evolved progressively in FN3Ks in response to changing cellular redox conditions. Our studies provide important new insights into the origin and evolution of redox regulation in the protein kinase superfamily and open new avenues for targeting human FN3K in diabetic complications.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000944	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8P41V			Fast and sensitive flow-injection mass spectrometry metabolomics by analyzing sample specific ion distributions	Mass spectrometry based metabolomics is a widely used approach in biotechnology and biomedical research. However, current methods coupling mass spectrometry with chromatography are time-consuming and not suitable for high-throughput analysis of thousands of samples. An alternative approach is flow-injection mass spectrometry (FI-MS) in which samples are directly injected to the ionization source. Here, we show that the sensitivity of Orbitrap FI-MS metabolomics methods is limited by ion competition effect in the detection system. We describe an approach for overcoming this effect by analyzing the distribution of ion m/z values and computationally determining a series of optimal scan ranges. This enables reproducible detection of ~9,000 and ~10,000 m/z features in metabolomics and lipidomics analysis of serum samples, respectively, with a sample scan time of ~15 seconds and duty time of ~30 seconds; a ~50% increase versus current spectral-stitching FI-MS. This approach facilitates high-throughput metabolomics for a variety of applications, including biomarker discovery and functional genomics screens.

In adult mammals, optic nerve injuries and progressive degenerative diseases lead to the irreversible loss of RGCs, resulting in blindness. Optogenetic models have proved useful in manipulating the growth of RGCs through expression of Channelrhodopsins (Chr2) and light stimulation. Using the transgenic Chr2 mouse (Thy1-ChR2-EYFP) as a model of regeneration, we present the profile the lipid changes that occur after optic nerve crush, light stimulation and RGC growth. Thy1-ChR2-EYFP mice and controls (C57BL/6) were divided in four groups each, no crush and no stimulation, no crush and stimulation, crush and no stimulation, crush and stimulation. After euthanasia, the optic nerves were collected for analysis. The Bligh and Dyer method was used for lipid extraction, followed by mass spectrometry lipid profiling on a high-resolution Q-Exactive instrument.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000946	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8DM63			Distinct metabolic states of a cell guide alternate fates of mutational buffering through altered proteostasis.	Changes in metabolism can alter the cellular milieu; can this also change intracellular proteostasis? Since proteostasis can modulate mutational buffering, if change in metabolism has the ability to change proteostasis, arguably, it should also alter mutational buffering. Building on this, we find that altered cellular metabolic states in E. coli buffer distinct mutations. Buffered-mutants had folding problems in vivo and were differently chaperoned in different metabolic states. Notably, this assistance was dependent upon the metabolites and not on the increase in canonical chaperone machineries. Additionally, we were able to reconstitute the folding assistance afforded by metabolites in vitro and propose that changes in metabolite concentrations have the potential to alter proteostasis. Collectively, we unravel that the metabolite pools are bona fide members of proteostasis and aid in mutational buffering. Given the plasticity in cellular metabolism, we posit that metabolic alterations may play an important role in the positive or negative regulation of proteostasis.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000948	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8540T			Plasmodium falciparum increased time in circulation underlies persistent asymptomatic infection in the dry season	The dry season is a major challenge for Plasmodium falciparum parasites in many malaria endemic regions, where water availability limits mosquitoes to only part of the year. How P. falciparum bridges two transmission seasons months apart, without being cleared by the host or compromising host survival is poorly understood. Here we show that low levels of P. falciparum parasites persist in the blood of asymptomatic Malian individuals during the 5- to 6-month dry season, rarely causing symptoms and minimally affecting the host immune response. Parasites isolated during the dry season are transcriptionally distinct from those of subjects with febrile malaria in the transmission season, reflecting longer circulation within each replicative cycle, of parasitized erythrocytes without adhering to the vascular endothelium. Low parasite levels during the dry season are not due to impaired replication, but rather increased splenic clearance of longer-circulating infected erythrocytes. We propose that P. falciparum virulence in areas of seasonal malaria transmission is regulated so that the parasite decreases its endothelial binding capacity, allowing increased splenic clearance and enabling several months of subclinical parasite persistence.

Whereas the effect of exogenous factors has been extensively investigated, endogenous, host-mediated mechanisms have remained largely unexplored. Concomitantly with microbial colonization, the liver undergoes functional transition from a hematopoietic organ to a central organ of metabolic regulation and immune surveillance. The aim of the present study was to analyze the influence of the developing hepatic function and liver metabolism on the early intestinal microbiota. Using metabolomic and microbial profiling in combination with multivariate analysis we characterized the colonization dynamics and liver metabolism in the murine gastrointestinal tract (n=6-10 per age group). We observed major age-dependent microbial and metabolic changes and identified bile acids as potent drivers of the early intestinal microbiota maturation. Consistently, oral administration of tauro-cholic acid or ß-tauro-murocholic acid to newborn mice (n= 7-14 per group) accelerated postnatal microbiota maturation.

DDLPS patients with higher MDM2 amplification have lower chemotherapy sensitivity and worse outcome than patients with lower MDM2 amplification. We hypothesized that MDM2 amplification levels may be associated with changes in DDLPS metabolism. Six patient-derived DDLPS cell line models were subject to comprehensive metabolomic (Metabolon) and lipidomic (SCIEX 5600 TripleTOF-MS) profiling to assess associations with MDM2 amplification and their responses to metabolic perturbations. Comparing metabolomic profiles between MDM2 higher and lower amplification cells yielded a total of 23 differentially abundant metabolites across both panels (FDR < 0.05, log2 FC < 0.75), including ceramides, glycosylated ceramides, and sphingomyelins. Disruption of lipid metabolism through statin administration resulted in a chemo-sensitive phenotype in MDM2 lower cell lines only, suggesting that lipid metabolism may be a large contributor to the more aggressive nature of MDM2 higher DDLPS tumors. This study is the first to provide comprehensive metabolomic and lipidomic characterization of DDLPS cell lines and provides evidence for MDM2-dependent differential molecular mechanisms that are critical factors in chemoresistance and could thus affect patient outcome.

Using a targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach, we found that axenic cultures of the Antarctic sea-ice diatom, Nitzschia lecointei, displayed large differences in their metabolomes when grown in a matrix of conditions that included temperatures of –1 and 4°C, and salinities of 32 and 41, despite relatively small changes in growth rate. Temperature exerted a greater effect than salinity on cellular metabolite pool sizes, though the N- or S-containing compatible solutes, 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate (DHPS), glycine betaine (GBT), dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), and proline responded strongly to both temperature and salinity, suggesting complexity in their control. We saw the largest (> 4 fold) response to salinity for proline. DHPS, a rarely studied but potential compatible solute, reached the highest intracellular compatible solute concentrations of ~ 85 mM. When comparing the culture findings to natural Arctic sea-ice diatom communities, we found extensive overlap in metabolite profiles, highlighting the relevance of culture-based studies to probe environmental questions. Large changes in sea-ice diatom metabolomes and compatible solutes over a seasonal cycle could be significant components of biogeochemical cycling within sea ice.

Aim: We performed a pilot study using state-of-the-art ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHRMS) to characterize the burden of lipophilic persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in metabolic tissues and associated alterations in the plasma metabolome. Methods: We studied 11 adolescents with severe obesity at the time of bariatric surgery. We measured 18 POPs that can act as endocrine and metabolic disruptors (i.e. 2 dioxins, 11 organochlorine compounds [OCs] and 5 polybrominated diphenyl ethers [PBDEs]) in visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (vAT and sAT), and liver samples using gas chromatography with UHRMS. Biological pathways were evaluated by measuring the plasma metabolome using high-resolution metabolomics. Network and pathway enrichment analysis assessed correlations between the tissue-specific burden of three frequently detected POPs (i.e. p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene [DDE], hexachlorobenzene [HCB] and PBDE-47) and plasma metabolic pathways. Results: Concentrations of 4 OCs and 3 PBDEs were quantifiable in at least one metabolic tissue for >80% of participants. All POPs had the highest median concentrations in adipose tissue, especially sAT, except for PBDE-154, which had comparable average concentrations across all tissues. Pathway analysis showed high correlations between tissue-specific POPs and metabolic alterations in pathways of amino acid metabolism, lipid and fatty acid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. Conclusions: Most of the measured POPs appear to accumulate preferentially in adipose tissue compared to liver. Findings of plasma metabolic pathways potentially associated with tissue-specific POPs concentrations merit further investigation in larger populations.

At any point in time, the difference between these two processes yields a carbon pool in surface particles that is a combination of both freshly fixed and partially degraded material. On a molecular level, we have a limited knowledge of the small molecules, or metabolites, within this pool. Specific metabolites have been shown to be responsible for fueling respiration, maintaining organismal interactions, and transferring energy throughout the microbial community. Metabolomics, or the direct observation and quantification of the small molecules that are the result of cellular activity, provides an important lens through which we can begin to assess the standing stocks of small compounds that likely fuel a great deal of heterotrophic activity in the surface ocean. Here we describe community metabolomes of particulate material into the North Pacific Ocean and compare the metabolomes to a variety of phytoplankton grown in the lab. Using both targeted and untargeted metabolomics, we identify metabolites in the particulate carbon pool and explore their latitudinal and phylogenetic distributions. This analysis reveals several compounds that have not been previously recognized as abundant components of the marine organic carbon pool. We found that the community metabolome showed distinct differences between the regimes that likely reflects the phytoplankton community present. The community metabolome in surface waters of the subtropical domain was remarkably consistent even when sampled weeks apart, while the northern regions showed a patchier and less reproducible community metabolome. Some individual compounds showed distinct patterns between oceanographic regimes, including homarine, an abundant molecule that can contribute up to 4% of the total particulate carbon pool in marine surface waters. Glutamic acid and glutamine showed opposite patterns in the oceanographic regimes, suggesting differences in community-level nitrogen assimilation in these different regimes. Overall, this study offers a new perspective into particulate carbon composition in oceanographic research, reveals important carbon pools that may fuel the microbial loop, and suggests an altered community-level nitrogen assimilation capacity over the North Pacific transition zone.

Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN), the most frequent T2D complication, is characterized by sensory peripheral nerve damage. Although managing glucose effectively slows DPN progression in type 1 diabetes patients, it has limited efficacy in neuropathic T2D patients. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) recently emerged as a major risk factor for DPN; however, the metabolites associated with MetS that correlate with DPN are unknown. We conducted a global plasma metabolomics analysis from a cohort of patients enrolled in the Anglo-Danish-Dutch study of Intensive Treatment of Diabetes in Primary Care (ADDITION), including healthy control subjects, T2D patients, and T2D DPN patients. We identified 15 total plasma metabolites that were altered in T2D DPN patients, including lipids, amino acids, and energy-related metabolites. We evaluated the correlation between these metabolites and all lipid species to identify major changes in both plasma free fatty acids and complex lipids in T2D DPN patients, and found significant alterations in the abundance of long-chain saturated fatty acids, acylcarnitines, and sphingolipids. Our study suggests that DPN in T2D is associated with novel alterations in plasma metabolites related to lipid metabolism.

Clin Microbiol Rev, 2019]. Currently, sputum culture remains the standard of care for lung infection detection, but sputum production is on the decline due to improvements in CF therapies. To fill this diagnostic gap, we are working toward the development of breath tests for lung infections by characterizing the volatile metabolome (or “volatilome”) of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. In this study, we explored the influence of growth medium on the volatilomes of two strains of P. aeruginosa (PAO1 and PA14) and S. aureus, as well as two other species from the same genera, S. epidermidis and P. chlororaphis. We hypothesized that the volatilomes would be influenced by the growth medium, but that biological differences between these species and strains would dominate the volatilomes and facilitate identification.

Even though the advances made in developmental biology the information available about organ maturation in the early stages of life is limited. This fact, together with the scarcity of clinical trials in children, sometimes leads to the use of off-label drugs. The best approximation to study organ maturation is analysing tissue samples but their collection requires a very invasive method. For this reason, a surrogate matrix such as plasma, which represents a snapshot of global organ/tissue metabolism, may be a suitable alternative.

Although MYC itself is considered undruggable, it may be possible to inhibit MYC by targeting the co-factors it uses to drive oncogenic gene expression patterns. Here, we use loss- and gain- of function approaches to interrogate how one MYC co-factor—Host Cell Factor (HCF)-1—contributes to MYC activity in a Burkitt lymphoma setting. We identify high-confidence direct targets of the MYC–HCF-1 interaction that are regulated through a recruitment-independent mechanism, including genes that control mitochondrial function and rate-limiting steps for ribosome biogenesis and translation. We describe how these gene expression events impact cell growth and metabolism, and demonstrate that the MYC–HCF-1 interaction is essential for tumor maintenance in vivo. This work highlights the MYC–HCF-1 interaction as a focal point for development of novel anti-cancer therapies.

Previously oral in vitro biofilms grown in saliva have shown proteolytic degradation of salivary proteins and increased extracellular proline. Although arginine and glucose have been shown before to have an effect on oral biofilm growth and activity, there is limited evidence for proline. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to identify extracellular metabolites produced by bacteria in oral biofilms grown on hydroxyapatite discs. Biofilms were inoculated with whole mouth saliva and then grown for 7 days using sterilised whole mouth saliva supplemented with proline, arginine and glucose as a growth-medium. Overall proline had a beneficial effect on biofilm growth – with significantly fewer dead bacteria present by biomass and surface area of the biofilms (p <0.05). Where arginine and glucose significantly increased and decreased pH, respectively, the pH of proline supplemented biofilms remained neutral at pH 7.3-7.5. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the spent saliva from proline and arginine supplemented biofilms showed inhibition of salivary protein degradation of immature biofilms. NMR analysis of the spent saliva revealed that proline supplemented biofilms were metabolically similar to unsupplemented biofilms, but these biofilms actively metabolised proline to 5-aminopentanoate, butyrate and propionate, and actively utilised glycine. This study shows that in a nutrient limited environment, proline has a beneficial effect on in vitro oral biofilms grown from a saliva inoculum.

The main cause underlying thrombosis and cardiovascular events is atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disease that can remain asymptomatic for long periods of time. There is an urgent need for new therapeutic and diagnostic options in this area. Atherosclerotic plaques have long been known to contain autoantibodies 1, 2, and there is a well-accepted connection between atherosclerosis and autoimmunity 3. However, the immunogenic trigger and the impact of the autoantibody response during atherosclerosis are not well understood 3, 4, 5. Here we performed a high-throughput single-cell analysis of the atherosclerosis-associated antibody repertoire. Antibody gene sequencing of more than 1700 B cells from atherogenic LDLR-/- mice and control animals identified 56 antibodies expressed by in-vivo-expanded clones of B lymphocytes in the context of atherosclerosis. A third of the expanded antibodies showed reactivity against the atherosclerotic plaque, indicating that various antigens in the lesion can trigger antibody responses. A deep proteomics analysis revealed aldehyde dehydrogenase 4 family member A1 (ALDH4A1), a mitochondrial dehydrogenase involved in proline metabolism, as target antigen of one of these autoantibodies, A12. We show that ALDH4A1 distribution is altered during atherosclerosis and circulating levels of ALDH4A1 are increased in mice and humans with atherosclerosis, supporting the potential use of ALDH4A1 as disease biomarker. A12 antibody infusion into LDLR-/- mice delayed plaque formation and reduced circulating levels of free cholesterol and LDL suggesting that anti-ALDH4A1 antibodies can play a protective role in atherosclerosis progression and might have therapeutic potential. Our study reveals a new auto-antigenic trigger target of the atherosclerosis-associated antibody response and opens new avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in CVD.

Much research on these diseases has focused on tissues such as adipose, liver, muscle and pancreas. The role of the gut in glucose metabolism is relatively unstudied; however, it can also have a significant effect on systemic glucose control. Residing in the gut is a complex community of microbes, termed microbiota, which are important contributors to immunity and metabolism, frequently mediating cross-talks between these two functions. Changes in the gut microbiota of type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients are directly linked to metabolic dysregulation in the disease. Therefore, the goal of the project is to identify and test microbes and microbial factors involved in regulation of glucose metabolism. For this, microbiota perturbation by western diet followed by global analyses of gut microbiome and host transcriptome combined with causal inference analysis is employed. Newly inferred probiotics are tested in mice fed with western diet followed by metabolomics analysis. This research provides a mechanistic explanation of how probiotics helps disclose mechanisms of T2D as well as will identify protective microbial factors for development of therapy of diabetes.

However, because of limited availability, many sample types are still difficult to study by metabolomic analyses. Here, we present a new mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics strategy that only consumes sub-nanoliter sample volumes. The approach consists of combining a customized metabolomics workflow with a pulsed MS ion generation method, known as triboelectric nanogenerator inductive nanoelectrospray ionization (TENGi nanoESI) MS. Samples tested for this approach included exhaled breath condensates (EBC) collected from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients as well as in vitro-cultured human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Both test samples were only available in minimum amounts. Experiments showed that picoliter-volume spray pulses sufficed to generate high-quality spectral fingerprints, which increased the information density produced per unit sample volume. This TENGi nanoESI strategy has the potential to fill in the gap in metabolomics where liquid chromatography-MS-based analyses cannot be applied. Our method could open up new avenues for future investigations into understanding metabolic changes caused by diseases or external stimuli.

Host intestine release D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) to degrade bacterial D-amino acids that results in regulation of microbiota. However, it is not clarified whether bacterial D-amino acids affect host’s immunity. In the present study, we investigated the metabolites in intestinal contents of DAO null mice compared to wild type animals. We did not find any significant difference in metabolites when we did not distinguish chirality. However, we found that DAO null mice had much higher amount of D-alanine in the intestinal epithelium, suggesting that D-alanine are involved in activated immune response in DAO null mice.

Methods: We conducted a cross-over laboratory study where 16 normal weight participants (8 men; age 22 ± 5 years; body mass index < 25 kg/m2) completed three baseline days (BL; 9h sleep opportunity per night) followed by five day insufficient (5H; 5h sleep opportunity per night) and adequate (9H; 9h sleep opportunity per night) sleep conditions. Energy balanced diets were provided during baseline, with ad libitum energy intake provided during the insufficient and adequate sleep conditions. Untargeted plasma metabolomics analyses were performed using blood samples collected every 4h across the final 24h of each condition. Biomarker models were developed using logistic regression and linear support vector machine algorithms. Results: The top performing biomarker model was developed by linear support vector machine modeling, consisted of 65 compounds, and discriminated insufficient versus adequate sleep with 74% overall accuracy and a Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient of 0.39. The compounds in the top performing biomarker model were associated with ATP Binding Cassette Transporters in Lipid Homeostasis, Phospholipid Metabolic Process, Plasma Lipoprotein Remodeling, and sphingolipid metabolism. Conclusion: We identified potential metabolomics-based biomarkers of insufficient sleep in humans. Further development and validation of omics-based biomarkers of insufficient sleep will advance our understanding of the negative consequences of insufficient sleep, improve diagnosis of poor sleep health, and identify targets for countermeasures designed to mitigate the negative health consequences of insufficient sleep.

Succinyl-CoA ligase (SCL) deficiency causes a mitochondrial encephalomyopathy of unknown pathomechanism. Here, we show that succinyl-CoA accumulates in cells derived from patients carrying recessive mutations in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) gene succinyl-CoA ligase subunit beta (SUCLA2) causing global protein hyper-succinylation. Using mass spectrometry, we quantified nearly 1000 protein succinylation sites on 366 proteins from patient-derived fibroblasts and myotubes. Interestingly, hyper-succinylated proteins are distributed across cellular compartments, and many are known targets of the (NAD+)-dependent desuccinylase SIRT5. To test the contribution of hyper-succinylation to disease progression, we developed a zebrafish model of the SCL deficiency, and find that SIRT5 gain-of-function reduces global protein succinylation and improves survival. Thus, increased succinyl-CoA levels contribute to the pathology of SCL deficiency through post-translational modifications.

In an ovine model with increased maternal cortisol over the last 0.20 of gestation, we have previously found evidence of disruption of fetal serum and cardiac metabolomics, and altered expression of genes related to mitochondrial function and metabolism in biceps femoris, diaphragm and cardiac muscle. The present studies were designed to test for effects of chronically increased maternal cortisol on gene expression and metabolomics in placentomes near term. We hypothesized that changes in placenta may underlie or contribute to the alterations in fetal serum metabolomics, and thereby contribute to changes in striated muscle metabolism. Placentomes were collected from pregnancies in early labor (143±1 d gestation) of control ewes (n=7) or ewes treated with cortisol (1 mg/kg/d iv; n=5) starting at day 115 of gestation. Transcriptomics and metabolomics were performed using an ovine gene expression microarray (Agilent 019921) and HR-MAS NMR, respectively. Multi-omic analysis indicates that amino acid metabolism, particularly of branched chain amino acids and glutamate occur in placenta; changes in amino acid metabolism, degradation or biosynthesis in placenta were consistent with changes in valine, isoleucine, leucine and glycine in fetal serum. The analysis also indicates changes in glycerophospholipid metabolism and suggests changes in ER stress and antioxidant status in the placenta. These findings suggest that changes in placental function occurring with excess maternal cortisol in late gestation may contribute to metabolic dysfunction at birth.

However, comprehensive metrics and methods to evaluate and compare the data quality of global metabolomics data sets are lacking. In this work, we combine newly developed metrics, along with well-known measures, to comprehensively and quantitatively characterize the data quality across two similar LC-MS platforms, with the goal of providing an efficient and improved ability to evaluate the data quality in global metabolite profiling experiments. A pooled human serum sample was run 50 times on two high-resolution LC-QTOF-MS platforms to provide profile and centroid MS data. These data were processed using Progenesis Qi software and then analyzed using five important data quality measures, including retention time drift, compound coverage, missing values and MS reproducibility (2 measures). The coverage was fit to a Gamma distribution versus compound abundance, which was normalized to allow comparison of different platforms. To evaluate missing values, characteristic curves were obtained by plotting the compound detection percentage versus extraction frequency. To characterize reproducibility, the accumulative coefficient of variation (CV) versus percentage of total compounds detected and CV vs intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) were investigated. Key findings include significantly better performance using profile mode data compared to centroid mode as well quantitatively better performance from the newer, higher resolution instrument. A summary of the results given in tabulated form gives a snapshot of the experimental results and provides a template to evaluate the global metabolite profiling workflow. In total, these measures give a good overall view of data quality in global profiling and allow comparisons of data acquisition strategies and platforms as well as optimization of parameters.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000997	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8TH75			ACSL1 role in conjugated PUFA metabolism	Ferroptosis is associated with lipid hydroperoxides generated by oxidation of polyunsaturated acyl chains. Lipid hydroperoxides are reduced by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and GPX4 inhibitors induce ferroptosis. However, the therapeutic potential of triggering ferroptosis in cancer cells with polyunsaturated fatty acids is unknown. We identified conjugated linoleates including a-eleostearate (aESA) as novel ferroptosis inducers. aESA did not alter GPX4 activity but was incorporated into cellular lipids and promoted lipid peroxidation and cell death in diverse cancer cell types. aESA-triggered death was mediated by acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain isoform 1, which promoted aESA incorporation into neutral lipids including triacylglycerols. Interfering with triacylglycerol biosynthesis suppressed ferroptosis triggered by aESA.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR000998	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8PQ57			Targeted metabolomic analysis on hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in flies on time restricted feeding	The integration of circadian and metabolic signals is essential for maintaining robust circadian rhythms and ensuring efficient metabolism and energy use. Using Drosophila as an animal model, we showed observed strong correlation between daily daily rhythms of protein O- linked N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) and clock-controlled feeding-fasting cycles, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation rhythms are primarily driven by nutrient input. Interestingly, daily O-GlcNAcylation rhythms were severely dampened when we subjected flies to time- restricted feeding (TRF) at unnatural feeding time. This suggests the presence of a clock- regulated buffering mechanism that prevents excessive O-GlcNAcylation at non-optimal times of the day-night cycle, which could disrupt circadian health. We performed targeted metabolomic analysis on hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), which produces UDP-GlcNAc (the substrate for O-GlcNAcylation), to evaluate the daily activity of HBP enzymes under TRF conditions. We found glutamine--fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) mediates this buffering mechanism.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001000	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8F982			Predicting T Cell Quality During Manufacturing Through an AI-based Integrative Multi-omics Analytical Platform	Large-scale, reproducible manufacturing of therapeutic cells with consistent high quality is vital for translation to clinically effective and widely accessible cell-therapies for patients. However, the biological and logistical complexity of manufacturing a living product, including challenges associated with their inherent variability as well as uncertainties of process parameters, currently make it difficult to achieve predictable cell-product quality. Using a degradable microscaffold-based T cell manufacturing process as an example, we developed an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven experimental-computational platform to identify a multivariate set of critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical quality attributes (CQAs) from heterogeneous, high dimensional, time-dependent multi-omics data, measurable during early stages of manufacturing and that are predictive of end-of-manufacturing product quality. Sequential, Design-of-Experiment (DOE)-based studies, coupled with a set of agnostic machine-learning framework, was used to extract multiple feature combinations from Day 4 to 6 media assessment, that were highly predictive (R2>90%) of the end-product phenotypes, specifically the total live CD4+ and CD8+ naïve and central memory T cells (CD63L+CCR7+ cells), and the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio. This generalizable workflow and computational platform could be broadly applied to any cell-therapy manufacturing process to identify multivariate early CQAs and CPPs that are predictable of final product quality.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001001	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M89H64			Lipidomics dataset of PTEN deletion-induced nerve regeneration mouse model	The optic nerve is part of the mammalian adult central nervous system (CNS) and has limited capability to regenerate after injury. Deletion of Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a negative regulator of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway, has been shown to promote regeneration in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) after nerve damage[1, 2]. We present the lipidome of adult PTENloxP/loxP mice subjected to intravitreal injection of adeno-associated viruses expressing Cre (AAV-Cre) as a model of regeneration. At 4-week-old, PTENloxP/loxP mice were intravitreally-injected with 2-3 µl of either AAV-Cre (KO) or AAV-PLAP (control), and two weeks later optic nerve crush was performed. At indicated time-points after crush (0 days, 7 days, 14 days), mice were euthanized and optic nerves were immediately dissected out, and then flash frozen on dry ice. The Bligh and Dyer method was used for lipid extraction, followed by mass spectrometry lipid profiling with a Q-Exactive Orbitrap Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (LC MS-MS). The raw scans were analysed with LipidSearch 4.2 and the statistical analysis was conducted through Metaboanalyst 4.0.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001002	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85T2G			NMR spectroscopy analysis reveals an altered metabolic homeostasis in Arabidopsis seedlings treated with a cytokinesis inhibitor	In plant cytokinesis, de novo formation of a cell plate that evolves into the new cell wall, partitions the cytoplasm of the dividing cell. Cell plate formation involves highly orchestrated vesicle accumulation, fusion, and membrane network maturation supported by the temporary integration of elastic and pliable callose. The small molecule, Endosidin 7 (ES7), arrests late cytokinesis in Arabidopsis by inhibiting callose deposition at the cell plate. Its effect is specific, as it does not broadly affect endomembrane trafficking or cytoskeletal organization. It has emerged as a very valuable tool for dissecting this essential plant process. In order to gain deeper insights regarding its mode of action and the effects of cytokinesis inhibition on overall plant growth, we investigated the effect of ES7 through a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy metabolomics approach. In this case study, profiles of Arabidopsis leaf and root tissues were analyzed at different growth stages and ES7 exposure levels. The results show tissue-specific changes in the plant metabolic profile across a developmental gradient, and the effect that ES7 treatment has on the corresponding metabolome. The ES7 induced profile suggests metabolic compensations in central metabolism pathways in response to cytokinesis inhibition. Further, this study shows that long-term treatment of ES7 disrupts the homeostasis of primary metabolism in Arabidopsis seedlings, likely via alteration of hormonal regulation

Sea-ice diatoms have a number of adaptations, including accumulation of compatible solutes, that allow them to inhabit this highly variable environment characterized by extremes in temperature, salinity, and light. In addition to protecting them from extreme conditions, these compounds present a labile, nutrient-rich source of organic matter and include precursors to climate active compounds (e.g. DMS), which are likely regulated with environmental change. Here, intracellular concentrations of 45 metabolites were quantified in three sea-ice diatom species and were compared to two temperate diatom species, with a focus on compatible solutes and free amino acid pools. There was a large diversity of metabolite concentrations between diatoms with no clear pattern identifiable for sea-ice species. Concentrations of some compatible solutes (isethionic acid, homarine) approached 1 M in the sea-ice diatoms, Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Navicula cf. perminuta, but not in the larger sea-ice diatom, Nitzschia lecointei or in the temperate diatom species. The differential use of compatible solutes in sea-ice diatoms suggest different adaptive strategies and highlights which small organic compounds may be important in polar biogeochemical cycles.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001005	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8SH6G			The effect of fasting and sirtuin overexpression on serum metabolome.	The levels of the sirtuins SIRT1 and SIRT6 are regulated by nutrient availability in several mammalian tissues. In addition, overexpressing SIRT1 in mice improves healthspan, while SIRT6 overexpression increases both healthspan and lifespan. However, little is known about the impact of these sirtuins at the in vivo metabolomics level. Thus, we performed metabolomics on serum taken from 15 months old male mice overexpressing SIRT1, SIRT6 and SIRT1+SIRT6 as well as WT controls. Sera were obtained from mice at three nutritional time points - at fed state, after 4h morning fast and after 16h fast.

Thus, combined biotic and abiotic stress treatments and the global assessment of their elicited metabolic expression remains largely unexplored. In this study, we employed targeted and untargeted metabolomics to investigate the metabolic responses of maize (Zea mays) to both individual and combinatorial stress treatments using heat (abiotic) and Cochliobolus heterostrophus infection (biotic) experiments. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry revealed significant metabolic responses to C. heterostrophus infection and heat stress, and comparative analyses between these individual forms of stress demonstrated differential elicitation between the two global metabolomes. In combinatorial experiments, treatment with heat stress prior to fungal inoculation negatively impacted maize disease resistance against C. heterostrophus, and distinct metabolome separation between combinatorial stressed plants and the non-heat stressed infected controls was observed. Targeted analysis revealed inducible primary and secondary metabolite responses to biotic/abiotic stress, and combinatorial experiments indicated that deficiency in the hydroxycinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, may lead to the heat-induced susceptibility of maize to C. heterostrophus. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that abiotic stress can predispose crops to more severe disease symptoms, underlining the increasing need to investigate defense chemistry in plants under combinatorial stress.

Improvements in serum lipid concentrations may play a role in these observed associations. Objective: We investigated how dietary patterns differing in glycemic load affect a clinical lipid panel and plasma lipidomics profiles. Methods: In a crossover, controlled feeding study, 80 healthy participants (n=40 men, n=40 women), 18-45 y were randomized to receive low-glycemic load (LGL) or high glycemic load (HGL) diets for 28 days each with at least a 28-day washout period between controlled diets. Fasting plasma samples were collected at baseline and end of each diet period. A clinical lipid panel including total-, VLDL-, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were measured using an auto-analyzer. Lipidomics analysis using mass-spectrometry provided the concentrations of 863 species. Linear mixed models were used to test for a diet effect. Results: Lipids from the clinical panel were not significantly different between diets. Lipidomics analysis showed that 67 lipid species, predominantly in the triacylglycerol class, differed between diets (FDR<0.05). A majority of these were higher after the LGL diet compared to the HGL. Conclusion: While the clinical lipid measures did not differ between diets, some lipid species were higher after the LGL diet in the lipidomics analysis. The two diets were eucaloric and had similar percentage of energy from carbohydrate, protein and fat. Thus, the difference in macronutrient, particularly carbohydrate, quality of the LGL diet is likely affecting the composition of lipid species.

A major hurdle to translation of this therapy is that direct application of NSCs to CNS injury does not support sufficient neurogenesis due to lack of proper cues. To provide prolonged spatial cues to NSCs IFN-? was immobilized to biomimetic hydrogel substrate to supply physical and biochemical signals to instruct the encapsulated NSCs to be neurogenic. However, the immobilization of factors, including IFN-?, versus soluble delivery of the same factor, has been incompletely characterized especially with respect to activation of signaling and metabolism in cells over longer time points. In this study, protein and metabolite changes in NSCs induced by immobilized versus soluble IFN-? at 7 days were evaluated. Soluble IFN-?, refreshed daily over 7 days, elicited stronger responses in NSCs compared to immobilized IFN-? indicating that immobilization may not sustain signaling or has altered ligand/receptor interaction and integrity. However, both IFN-? delivery types supported increased ßIII tubulin expression in parallel with canonical and non-canonical receptor-signaling compared to no IFN-?. Global metabolomics and pathway analysis revealed that soluble and immobilized IFN-? altered metabolic pathway activities including energy, lipid and amino acid synthesis, with soluble IFN-? having the greatest metabolic impact overall.

Fecal samples were collected on days 5-7 (baseline), 26-28, and 82-84. The fecal microbiome was analyzed by qPCR and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes; time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to determine metabolomic profiles. Split plot repeated measures ANOVAs were used to compare results between treatment groups. P < 0.05 was considered significant, with Benjamini & Hochberg’s False Discovery Rate used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Alpha diversity metrics differed significantly over time in both treatment groups, with incomplete recovery by days 82-84. Beta diversity and the dysbiosis index differed significantly over time and between treatment groups, with incomplete recovery at days 82-84 for dogs in the placebo group. Significant group-by-time interactions were noted for 15 genera, including Adlercreutzia, Bifidobacterium, Slackia, Turicibacter, Clostridium, [Ruminococcus], Erysipelotrichaceae_g_, [Eubacterium], and Succinivibrionaceae_g_. Group and time effects were present for six genera, including Collinsella, Ruminococcaceae_g_, and Prevotella. Metabolite profiles differed significantly by group-by-time, group, and time for 28, 20, and 192 metabolites, respectively. These included short-chain fatty acid, bile acid, tryptophan, sphingolipid, benzoic acid, and cinnaminic acid metabolites, as well as fucose and ethanolamine. Changes in many taxa and metabolites persisted through days 82-84.

Isosteviol sodium (STV-Na) is a terpenoid derived from stevioside that exerts anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anticancer activities. However, the influence of STV-Na on sepsis remains unknown. Here, we assessed the potential effects of STV-Na on sepsis and multiple organ injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that STV-Na increased the survival rate of mice treat with LPS, significantly improved the functions of the heart, lung, liver, and kidney, and reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, Multiorgan metabolomics analysis demonstrated that glutathione metabolism, purine metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, were significantly altered by STV-Na. This study provides novel insights into the metabolite changes of multiple organ injury in septic mice, which may help characterize the underlying mechanism and provide an improved understanding of the therapeutic effects of STV-Na on sepsis.

Metabolite production is not identical among phytoplankton, and the flux of these molecules through the microbial loop depends on compound-specific bioavailability to a wider microbial community. Yet relatively little is known about the diversity or concentration of polar metabolites within marine plankton. Here we evaluate 313 metabolites in 21 phytoplankton species and in natural marine particles across environmental gradients to show that bulk community metabolomes reflect the phytoplankton community on a chemical level.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001025	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M86M5V			Prochlorococcus extracellular vesicles: Molecular composition and adsorption to diverse microbial cells	Extracellular vesicles are small (~50–200 nm diameter) membrane-bound structures released by cells from all domains of life. While extremely abundant in the oceans, our understanding of their functions, both for cells and the emergent ecosystem, is in its infancy. To advance this understanding, we analyzed the lipid, metabolite, and protein content of vesicles produced by two strains of the most abundant phytoplankton cell in the ocean, the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus. We show that Prochlorococcus exports an enormous array of cellular compounds into their surroundings via extracellular vesicles. The vesicles produced by the two different strains contained some materials in common, but also displayed numerous strain-specific differences, reflecting functional complexity within natural vesicle populations. Prochlorococcus vesicles contain active enzymes, indicating that they can mediate biogeochemically relevant extracellular reactions in the wild. Interaction assays demonstrate that vesicles from Prochlorococcus and multiple genera of heterotrophic bacteria can associate with other marine microbes, including Pelagibacter, the most abundant heterotrophic group in the oceans. Our observations suggest that vesicles may play diverse functional roles in the oceans, including but not limited to mediating energy and nutrient transfers, catalyzing extracellular biochemical reactions, and mitigating toxicity of reactive oxygen species. These findings further indicate that a portion of the ‘dissolved’ compounds in the oceans are not truly dissolved, but are instead packaged within locally structured, colloidal vesicles.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001027	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8Z41B			Mitochondrial health is enhanced in rats with higher vs. lower intrinsic exercise capacity and extended lifespan	The intrinsic aerobic capacity of an organism is thought to play a role in aging and longevity. Maximal respiratory rate capacity, a metabolic performance measure, is one of the best predictors of cardiovascular- and all-cause mortality. Rats selectively bred for high-(HCR) vs. low-(LCR) intrinsic running-endurance capacity have up to 31% longer lifespan. We found that positive changes in indices of mitochondrial health in cardiomyocytes (respiratory reserve, maximal respiratory capacity, resistance to mitochondrial permeability transition, autophagy/mitophagy, higher lipids-over-glucose utilization) are uniformly associated with the extended longevity in HCR vs. LCR female rats. Cross-sectional heart metabolomics revealed pathways from lipid metabolism in the heart which were significantly enriched by a select group of strain dependent metabolites, consistent with enhanced lipids utilization by HCR cardiomyocytes. Heart-liver-serum metabolomics further revealed shunting of lipidic substrates between liver and heart via serum during aging. Thus, mitochondrial health in cardiomyocytes is associated with extended longevity in rats with higher intrinsic exercise capacity, and likely these findings can be translated to other populations as predictors of outcomes of health and survival.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001029	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8PM56			?-Adrenergic regulation of metabolism in macrophages	Macrophages have important roles in the immune system including clearing pathogens and wound healing. Metabolic phenotypes have been associated with functional phenotypes, where pro-inflammatory macrophages have an increased rate of glycolysis and anti-inflammatory macrophages primarily use oxidative phosphorylation. ß-adrenoceptor (ßAR) signalling in macrophages has been implicated in disease states such as cancer, atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The impact of ß-adrenoceptor signalling on macrophage metabolism has not been defined. Here we expand on defining the phenotype of macrophages treated with isoprenaline and describe the impact that ßAR signalling has on the metabolome and proteome. We found that ßAR signalling alters proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement and redox control of the cell. We showed that ßAR signalling in macrophages shifts glucose metabolism from glycolysis towards the tricarboxylic acid cycle and pentose phosphate pathways. We also show that ßAR signalling perturbs purine metabolism by accumulating adenylate pools. Taken together these results indicate that ßAR signalling shifts metabolism to support redox perturbations and upregulate proteins involved in cytoskeletal changes that may impact migration and phagocytosis processes.

The mechanisms behind how caloric imbalance occurs are complex and influenced by numerous biological and environmental factors, especially genetics and diet. Population-based diet recommendations have had limited success partly due to the wide variation in physiological responses across individuals when they consume the same diet. Thus, it is necessary to broaden our understanding of how individual genetics and diet interact relative to the development of obesity for improving weight loss treatment. To determine how consumption of diets with different macronutrient composition alter adiposity and other obesity-related traits in a genetically diverse population, we analyzed body composition, metabolic rate, clinical blood chemistries, and circulating metabolites in 22 strains of mice from the Collaborative Cross (CC), a highly diverse recombinant inbred mouse population, before and after 8 weeks of feeding either a high protein or high fat high sucrose diet. At both baseline and post-diet, adiposity and other obesity-related traits exhibited a broad range of phenotypic variation based on CC strain; diet-induced changes in adiposity and other traits also depended largely on CC strain. In addition to estimating heritability at baseline, we also quantified the effect size of diet for each trait, which varied by trait and experimental diet. Our findings identified CC strains prone to developing obesity, demonstrate the genotypic and phenotypic diversity of the CC for studying complex traits, and highlight the importance of accounting for genetic differences when making dietary recommendations.

Most often, such tracers are used with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) due to its ease of operation and reproducible mass spectral databases. Differences in isotope tracer performance of classic GC-quadrupole MS instrument and newer time-of-flight instruments are not well-studied. Here, we used three commercially available instruments for the analysis of identical samples from a stable isotope labeling study that used [U-13C6] d-glucose to investigate the metabolism of Rothia mucilaginosa with respect to 29 amino acids and hydroxyl acids involved in primary metabolism. Overall, all three GC-MS instruments (low-resolution GC-SQ-MS, low-resolution GC-TOF-MS, and high-resolution GC-Q-TOF-MS) can be used to perform stable isotope tracing studies for glycolytic intermediates, TCA metabolites and amino acids, yielding similar biological results, with high-resolution GC-Q-TOF-MS offering additional capabilities to identify chemical structures of unknown compounds that might show significant isotope enrichments in biological studies.

Due to its toxic and chemical properties, ricin is a potential agent of bioterrorism but has also been studied for therapeutic use in immunotoxins. Previous research by our group has demonstrated lethal hypoglycemia associated with ricin toxicity. Research efforts have focused on better understanding this ricin-induced metabolic state of hypoglycemia to aid in better understanding the systemic effects of hypoglycemia, and the use of ricin in immunotherapy. Here, we have used a mouse model to characterize liver metabolome changes associated with hypoglycemia induced by two conditions. Mice were challenged with intraperitoneal injections of ricin at high and low doses for 2 hrs, 8 hrs, and overnight. To understand how ricin-induced hypoglycemia differs from that of fasting, another group of mice had food withheld for 8-hours and overnight. 1H NMR-based metabolomics was performed on polar molecules extracted from mouse livers, with metabolites annotated using Chenomx software. MetaboAnalyst was employed for multivariate statistical analysis. In this study, similar decreases in blood glucose in mice were observed following injection of a lethal dose of ricin and with overnight fasting. NMR analyses identified 59 polar metabolites present in mice livers from all treatments. Multivariate statistical analyses were used to evaluate global metabolic state differences. Results from these analyses indicated that the profiled liver metabolomes for mice subjected to the two conditions differ significantly at both 8 hours and overnight. Additionally, ricin treatment with a lethal dose reveal a progression of metabolic changes over time, from 2 to 22 hours. Additionally, mass spectrometry supported these findings, and NMR analyses revealed key metabolites that contribute to these differences. While both ricin and fasting induce hypoglycemia, the metabolic states resulting from these two conditions are different. Further analyses may give insights into mechanisms of ricin toxicity, specific metabolic pathways that are altered, and potential treatments for hypoglycemia. We propose to extend these studies to insulin-induced hypoglycemia.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001038	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8HX30			Metabolomics Analysis: Opioid Addiction Project 	Drug addiction is a major threat to the public health in the US and many other countries. Opioid abuse is associated with increased risks for cancer, psychological complications, heart and lung disease, and infections of the liver and blood. Because metabolites are intrinsically involved in multiple metabolic pathways in vivo, the relative quantification of metabolites in body fluids (for example urine) can provide a profile of the metabolic state of an organism. Metabolomics is a powerful technique for revealing the impact of exposure on the overall biochemistry of an individual or system. Opioids can modify the output of urinary metabolites through many integrated neural and hormonal mechanisms within the periphery, central nervous system, and kidneys. Opioids modulate the expression of genes involved in neuroplasticity through epigenetic and possibly RNA modifications, ultimately change the intracellular signaling cascades and dysfunction, and cause long-lasting changes in metabolome. The objective of this study is to identify how opium impacts metabolic pathways to provide markers of abuse, long-term opium addiction, the addiction molecular pathway, and unknown metabolites that are important to differentiation of the study phenotypes. To reach these goals in the present study, the urine specimens of opium abusers and non-users as controls was profiled using an untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) metabolomics, and a quantitative targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Golestan Cohort Study is conducted in Northeast of Iran to primarily study the risk factors for upper gastrointestinal cancers in this high-risk region, in which about 50,000 volunteers were analyzed for opium users and their mortality. More than 8,000 of participants (17%) age 40-75 reported opium use with a mean duration of 12.7 years. Opium was either smoked or orally consumed. The participants were selected from the cohort stratified by opium use patterns and tobacco use.

However, it remains obscure how dietary and psychosocial inputs coordinately modulate the gut microbiota and host impact. Here, we show that dietary raffinose metabolism to fructose couples stress-induced gut microbial remodeling to intestinal stem cells (ISC) renewal and epithelial homeostasis. Chow diet (CD) and purified diet (PD) confer distinct vulnerability to gut epithelial injury, microbial alternation and ISC dysfunction in chronically restrained mice. CD preferably enriches Lactobacillus reuteri, and its colonization is sufficient to rescue stress-triggered epithelial injury.

The goal of this project is to address questions on the mechanisms of (and potential solutions to) obesity that results directly from diet exposures and the associated chemotherapeutic resistance. In a mouse model of basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), we compared a high protein (HP) diet to a high carbohydrate plus high fat (HCHF) diet and determined their comparative impacts on body weight, fatty liver development, tumor growth acute chemotherapy response to doxorubicin, profiled 80 inflammatory markers and performed untargeted metabolomics. Briefly, female C57BL/6 mice were fed either the HP or HCHF diet for 15 weeks, orthotopically implanted with MMTV-Wnt-1 mammary cells for tumor formation and growth (up to six weeks), then treated with a single dose of doxorubicin (or saline vehicle control) for 24 hours prior to study completion. Mice were euthanized and biospecimens were collected at the following study endpoints: 1-baseline (following 1-week quarantine); 2-after the 15 weeks of differential diet exposure; 3-after 5 weeks and 5.5 weeks of tumor growth; and 4-after 24 hours of treatment, corresponding to 6 weeks of tumor growth. Untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed by UPLC high resolution mass spectrometry (LCMS) on liver samples at the four study endpoints described above. Liver tissues were sectioned into three discrete lobes (right, left and median=caudate + quadrate) prior to analysis.

While GmMYB176 is important for isoflavonoid synthesis, it is not sufficient for the function and requires additional cofactor(s). The aim of this study was to identify how the GmMYB176 protein complex affects the metabolome of soybean hairy roots using non-targeted high resolution mass spectrometry.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001047	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8C68D			A Metabolome Atlas of the Aging Mouse Brain	The mammalian brain relies on neurochemistry to fulfill its functions. Yet, the complexity of the brain metabolome and its changes during diseases or aging remains poorly understood. To start bridging this gap, we generated a metabolome atlas of the aging mouse brain from 10 anatomical regions spanning from adolescence to late adulthood. We combined data from three chromatography-based mass spectrometry assays and structurally annotated 1,709 metabolites to reveal the underlying architecture of aging-induced changes in the brain metabolome. Overall differences between sexes were minimal. We found 94% of all metabolites to significantly differ between brain sections in at least one age group. We also discovered that 90% of the metabolome showed significant changes with respect to age groups. For example, we identified a shift in sphingolipid patterns during aging that is related to myelin remodeling in the transition from adolescent to adult brains. This shift was accompanied by large changes in overall signature in a range of other metabolic pathways. We found clear metabolic similarities in brain sections that were functionally related such as brain stem, cerebrum and cerebellum. In cerebrum, metabolic correlation patterns got markedly weaker in the transition from adolescent to ear adults, whereas correlation patterns between cerebrum and brainstem regions decreased from early to late adulthood. We were also able to map metabolic changes to gene and protein brain atlases to link molecular changes to metabolic brain phenotypes. Metabolic profiles can be investigated via https://atlas.metabolomics.us/. This new resource enables brain researchers to link new metabolomic studies to a foundation data set.

Thus far, single-omics studies have failed to identify such T1D biomarkers. Here, we present proof-of-concept studies to demonstrate the potential for identifying integrated biomarker signature(s) of T1D using parallel multi-omics. Blood from human subjects at high risk for T1D (and healthy controls; n=4 each) were subjected to parallel unlabeled proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics. The integrated dataset was analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software for disturbances in the at-risk subjects compared to the controls.

Genome-wide association studies identified SLC16A13 as novel target gene in type 2 diabetes. The SLC16A13 gene encodes for SLC16A13/MCT13, a member of the solute carrier 16 family of monocarboxylate transporters. So far, biology and physiological function of SLC16A13 is unknown. Deletion of Slc16a13 is hypothezised to affect intrahepatocellular monocarboxylate availability, that drives increased oxidative phosphorylation, while reducing hepatic lipid content, thereby attenuating hepatic insulin resistance.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001052	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8QD76			In Vitro Characterization and Metabolomic Analysis of Cold-Stored Platelets	Platelet concentrates are currently stored at room temperature (RPs) under constant agitation for up to 5-7 days depending on national regulations. However, platelet quality deteriorates during storage and room temperature storage also increases the risk of bacterial growth. Previous studies have shown that cold-stored platelets (CPs) have higher hemostatic function and can be stored for up to three weeks. While these studies have compared the metabolic phenotypes of CPs and RPs, they have not compared the impact of storage temperature and cold agitation (CPAs) on platelet function, nor have they identified metabolic correlates to such parameters. In vitro analysis showed CPAs and CPs had reduced count, faster CD62P expression and increased lactadherin binding. Furthermore, CPAs and CPs had higher maximal aggregation and a reduced aggregation lag phase compared to RPs. Metabolomic analysis revealed CPAs and CPs exhibited lower oxidative stress shown by preserved glutathione and pentose phosphate pools. CPAs and CPs also had reduced markers of beta-oxidation and amino acid catabolism demonstrating reduced needs for energy. Agitation did not significantly impact in vitro function or metabolomic parameters of cold-stored platelets. Correlation of in vitro and metabolomic results highlighted important metabolites that may contribute to stored platelet functions.

Such biomarkers can improve the safety of analytic treatment interruption (ATI) and provide mechanistic insights into the pathways involved in post-ART HIV control. We identified plasma glycomic and metabolic signatures of time-to-viral-rebound and probability-of-viral-rebound using samples from two independent cohorts. These samples include a large number of post-treatment controllers, a rare population demonstrating sustained virologic suppression after ART-cessation. The signatures remained significant after adjusting for key demographic and clinical confounders. We also confirmed a mechanistic link between biomarkers and HIV latency reactivation and myeloid inflammation in vitro. Finally, machine learning algorithms selected sets of biomarkers that predict time-to-viral-rebound with 74-76% capacity and probability-of-viral-rebound with 97.5% capacity. In summary, we fill a major gap in HIV cure research by identifying non-invasive biomarkers, with potential functional significance, that predict duration and probability of viral remission after treatment interruption.

One of the important strategies for plants to deal with the stress is involved in metabolic regulation, causing the dramatic changes of metabolite profiles. Metabolomic studies have been intensively conducted to reveal the responses of plants to abiotic stress, but most of them were limited to one or at most two abiotic stresses in a single experiment. In this study, we compared the metabolite profiles of barley seedlings exposed to seven abiotic stresses simultaneously, including drought, salt stress, aluminum (Al), cadmium (Cd), deficiency of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). The results showed that metabolite profiles of barley under these stresses could be classified into three types: osmotic stresses (drought and salt); metal stresses (Al and Cd) and nutrient deficiencies (N, P and K deficiencies). Compared with the control, some metabolites (including polyamines, raffinose and piperonic acid) in plants exposed to all abiotic stresses changed significantly, while some other metabolites showed the specific change only under a certain abiotic stress, such as proline being largely increased by osmotic stress (drought and salinity), the P-containing metabolites being largely decreased under P deficiency, some amino acids (lysine, tyrosine, threonine, ornithine? glutamine and so on) showing the dramatic reduction in the plants exposed to N deficiencies, respectively. The current meta-analysis obtained a comprehensive view on the metabolic responses to various abiotic stress, and improved the understanding of the mechanisms for tolerance of barley to abiotic stress.

We find that P. falciparum SB1-A6 accumulates both a copy number variation and a specific mutation in PfDHODH, and both of these genetic polymorphisms contribute to the panresistant phenotype. This study uncovers a mechanism of cross-resistance between PfDHODH and mtETC inhibitors and serves as a cautionary note to future antimalarial combination therapy formulations containing such drugs.

Despite its increasing incidence, the underlying molecular processes of anaphylaxis remain unclear and there are not known biomarkers for appropriate diagnosis. The mechanism associated to the reactions still needs to be clarified in humans. The rapid onset and potentially fatal outcome in the absence of managed treatment, prevent its study and prompt obvious technical and ethical implications. Twenty episodes of anaphylaxis were analyzed. Sera was collected at different times: during the acute phase (T1), the recovery phase (T2) and around 2-3 months after the anaphylactic reaction (T0). The analysis included untargeted metabolomics combining liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and proton-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR). Reactions were classified according to the trigger (food and/or drug) and severity (moderate and severe). “Food T1 vs T2” and “moderate T1 vs T2” anaphylaxis comparisons showed clear metabolic patterns during the onset of an anaphylactic reaction, which differed from those induced by drugs, food+drug or severe anaphylaxis “T1 vs T2”. Moreover, the model of food anaphylaxis was able to distinguish the well-characterized IgE (beta-lactam) from non-IgE- mediated anaphylaxis (NSAIDs), suggesting a differential metabolic pathway associated with the mechanism of action. Moreover, metabolic differences between “moderate vs severe” at T1 and T0 were studied. Among the metabolites, glucose, lipids, cortisol, betaine and oleamide were observed altered. The results of the study provide the first evidence that different anaphylactic triggers, induce differential metabolic changes. Besides, the basal status might identify high risk patients, thus opening new ways to understand, diagnose and treat anaphylaxis.

In this study, the IPL treatment was ap-plied to E. coli K-12 for 0-20s, leading to time- and dose-dependent changes in E.coli metabolome. We consider the degradation of membrane-bound quinone electron carriers as the trigger of dramatic metabolis shift in IPL-treated E.coli.

DNA unlinking involves the physical passage of one DNA duplex through another and depends on the transient formation of double-strand DNA breaks, a step exploited by frontline chemotherapies to kill cancer cells. Although anti-topo II drugs are efficacious, they also elicit cytotoxic side effects in normal cells; insights into how topo II is regulated in different cellular contexts is essential to improve their targeted use. Using chemical fractionation and mass spectrometry, we have discovered that topo II is subject to metabolic control through the TCA cycle. We show that TCA metabolites stimulate topo II activity in vitro and that levels of TCA flux modulate cellular sensitivity to anti-topo II drugs in vivo. Our works reveals an unanticipated connection between the control of DNA topology and cellular metabolism, a finding with important ramifications for the clinical use of anti-topo II therapies.

In highly endemic areas, e.g., Phoenix and Tucson, up to 30% of community-acquired pneumonia may be caused by Valley fever, and cases are on the rise. The current diagnostics for Valley fever are severely lacking due to invasiveness (biopsy) and poor sensitivity (serology), strongly contributing to an unacceptable 23-day median time-to-diagnosis. There is a critical need for sensitive and non-invasive diagnostics for identifying Valley fever lung infections. Our long-term goal is to substantially shorten the time-to-diagnosis for Valley fever through the development of sensitive and specific breath-based diagnostics for coccidioidomycosis lung infections. The overall objective of this application is to identify and validate putative volatile biomarkers of Coccidioides infections via metabolomics analyses of in vitro cultures, mouse model lung infections, and lung specimens from humans with Valley fever. At the completion of the proposed study, we expect to have identified and validated a panel of 10-15 volatile biomarkers for the sensitive and specific detection of valley fever in lung specimens.

Current drug efforts that are used to combat this deadly disease often employ pharmacologic strategies that inhibit critical parasite metabolic functions. Compounds used in the present study have generated resistance mutations in major acetyl-CoA producing enzymes. Hence, we set out to test the metabolic effects of these compounds on Plasmodium falciparum parasites including those on acetyl-CoA production by treating parasites for 2.5 hours under 10xIC50 of the test compounds. We used a targeted HPLC/mass spectrometry-based approach to analyze parasite metabolism. We find that multiple compounds tested in these studies have led to relative decreases in acetyl-CoA abundance compared to control parasite conditions. These studies are necessary for understanding pharmacology effects on the most virulent human malaria parasite.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001066	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8X12C			Extension of Diagnostic Fragmentation Filtering for Automated Discovery in DNA Adductomics	Development of high resolution/accurate mass liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methodology enables the characterization of covalently modified DNA induced by interaction with genotoxic agents in complex biological samples. Constant neutral loss monitoring of 2´-deoxyribose or the nucleobases using data-dependent acquisition represents a powerful approach for the unbiased detection of DNA modifications (adducts). The lack of available bioinformatics tools necessitates manual processing of acquired spectral data and hampers high throughput application of these techniques. To address this limitation, we present an automated workflow for the detection and curation of putative DNA adducts by using diagnostic frag-mentation filtering of LC-MS/MS experiments within the open-source software MZmine. The workflow utilizes a new feature detection algorithm, DFBuilder, which employs diagnostic fragmentation filtering using a user-defined list of fragmentation pat-terns to reproducibly generate feature lists for precursor ions of interest. The DFBuilder feature detection approach readily fits into a complete small molecule discovery workflow and drastically reduces the processing time associated with analyzing DNA adductomics results. We validate our workflow using a mixture of authentic DNA adduct standards and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by reproducing and expanding the results of a previously published study of colibactin-induced DNA adducts. The reported workflow serves as a technique to assess the diagnostic potential of novel fragmentation pattern combinations for the unbiased detection of chemical classes of interest.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001067	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8S69H			Urinary LCMS metabolimc study in bladder cancer	Bladder cancer (BC) is among the most frequent malignancies worldwide. Novel non-invasive markers are needed to diagnose and stage BC with more accuracy than invasive procedures such as cystoscopy. Our aim was to discover novel urine metabolomic profiles to diagnose and stage non-muscle invasive (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive (MIBC) patients using ultra-performance liquid chromatography analysis (UPLC)-based metabolomics. We prospectively recruited 64 BC patients (19 TaG1, 11 TaG3, 20 T1G3, 12 T2G3, 1 T2G2, 1 T3G3) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers without evidence of renal or bladder condition confirmed by ultrasound, from whom we collected a first morning urine sample (before surgery in patients). We conducted a UPLC-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-ToF MS) untargeted metabolomic analysis in all urine samples. We selected the discriminant variables between groups with a supervised orthogonal-least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) analysis and we identified them by querying their exact mass against those presented in online databases through a mediator platform. Subsequently, we confirmed the dysregulated metabolites when chemical standards were commercially available. We compared all clinical groups of patients with controls and we identified dysregulated metabolites in every comparison. Of these, we confirmed p-cresol glucuronide as potential diagnostic biomarker, and potential staging tool for NMIBC patients. Among NMIBC patients, we identified p-coumaric acid as a potential staging biomarker for milder NMIBC stages (TaG1). Additionally, we confirmed spermine and adenosine as potential staging biomarkers for MIBC. This is the first study conducted in urine samples of most stages of NMIBC and MIBC and healthy controls to identify non-invasive biomarkers. Once confirmed, these may improve BC management thus reducing the use of current harmful diagnostic techniques.

Cytoplasmic metabolites of the control and IPL-treated E. coli were examined by the liquid chromatography-mass spectrom-etry (LC-MS)-based metabolomic fingerprinting. The results from multivariate modeling and marker identification indicated that the metabolites in redox response, glycolysis, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism were selectively affected by the IPL treatments.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001070	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8D12Q			Branched-chain alpha-ketoacids are preferentially reaminated and activate protein synthesis in the heart	Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and their cognate a-ketoacids (BCKA) are elevated in an array of cardiometabolic diseases. Here we demonstrate that the major metabolic fate of uniformly-13C-labeled a-ketoisovalerate ([U-13C]KIV) in the heart is reamination to valine. Activation of cardiac branched-chain a-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) by treatment with the BCKDH kinase inhibitor, BT2, does not impede the strong flux of [U-13C]KIV to valine. Sequestration of BCAA and BCKA away from mitochondrial oxidation is likely due to low levels of expression of the mitochondrial BCAA transporter SLC25A44 in the heart, as its overexpression significantly lowers accumulation of [13C]-labeled valine from [U-13C]KIV. Finally, exposure of perfused hearts to levels of BCKA found in obese rats increased increases phosphorylation of the translational repressor 4E-BP1 as well as multiple proteins in the MEK-ERK pathway, leading to a doubling of total protein synthesis. These data suggest that elevated BCKA levels found in obesity may contribute to pathologic cardiac hypertrophy via chronic activation of protein synthesis.

Here, we performed a genetic screen in a zebrafish model with beta-cell loss to identify pathways promoting beta-cell regeneration. We found that both folate receptor 1 (folr1) overexpression and treatment with folate intermediates, i.e. tetrahydrofolic acid (THF) or folinic acid stimulated beta-cell differentiation in zebrafish. Treatment with these folate intermediates also stimulated beta-cell differentiation in neonatal pig islet cultures, showing the effect could be translated to a mammalian system. In both zebrafish and neonatal pig islets, the increased beta-cell differentiation originated from ductal cells. Mechanistically, comparative metabolomics analyses of zebrafish in the basal state vs following ?-cell ablation and in un-treated vs folinic acid-treated zebrafish indicated beta-cell regeneration could be attributed to changes in the pyrimidine, carnitine and serine pathways. Overall, our results suggest evolutionary conserved and previously unknown roles of folic acid and one-carbon metabolism in the generation of beta-cell .

However, difficulty in accurate and high-throughput functional analysis of human gut microbes has hindered defining mechanistic connections between individual microbial strains and host phenotypes. One key way the gut microbiome influences host physiology is through the production of small molecules1–3, yet progress in elucidating this chemical interplay has been hindered by limited tools calibrated to detect products of anaerobic biochemistry in the gut. Here we construct a microbiome-focused, integrated mass-spectrometry pipeline to accelerate the identification of microbiota-dependent metabolites (MDMs) in diverse sample types. We report the metabolic profiles of 178 gut microbe strains using our library of 833 metabolites. Leveraging this metabolomics resource we establish deviations in the relationships between phylogeny and metabolism, use machine learning to discover novel metabolism in Bacteroides, and employ comparative genomics-based discovery of candidate biochemical pathways. MDMs can be detected in diverse body fluids in gnotobiotic and conventional mice and traced back to corresponding metabolomic profiles of cultured bacteria. Collectively, our microbiome-focused metabolomics pipeline and interactive metabolomics profile explorer are a powerful tool for characterizing microbe and microbe-host interactions.

Children from rural regions are particularly understudied but may experience higher exposures to contaminants by drinking unregulated water; from household air pollution from wood stoves; and consequent to their rural and changing landscape (e.g., from climate change). This study aims to investigate new hypotheses and contribute critical exposomic data to address major gaps in our knowledge about early life environmental influences on child health and development in a rural US pregnancy cohort. As part of the ECHO Pediatric Cohorts, we are working with the NIEHS/EPA-supported New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS): a rural, ongoing pregnancy cohort that has accrued over 1,500 maternal-infant dyads with planned expansion to include 3,000 maternal-infant pairs. The study aims to: 1. Leverage the extant NHBCS to perform targeted and unsupervised metabolomic analyses of 1,000 cord blood samples and 250 paired maternal gestational blood samples, and assess associations with exposures, early growth, and the infant microbiome; 2. Expand data acquisition, sample collection and participant accrual to more precisely characterize exposures and timing of early life exposures; and 3. Extend follow-up to identify childhood exposures to contaminants (; the home environment; and medical exposures that relate to fetal and childhood growth, childhood obesity, and childhood respiratory infection, asthma, and pulmonary function. Additionally, novel statistical approaches will be used to determine the role of the intestinal and salivary microbiome as mediators of these effects. The collective expertise, methodologies, data, samples and preliminary results from this study will contribute to the planning of the broader ECHO Pediatric Cohorts initiative in order to advance our understanding of the environmental factors early in life that drive childhood and lifelong health.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001089	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8XT42			A cross-sectional study of functional and metabolic changes during aging through the lifespan in male mice	Aging is associated with distinct phenotypical, physiological, and functional changes, leading to the onset of disease and death. The progression of aging-related traits varies widely among individuals, influenced by their environment, lifestyle, and genetics. In this study, we performed physiologic and functional tests cross-sectionally throughout the entire lifespan of male C57BL/6N mice. In parallel, metabolomics analyses in serum, brain, liver, heart, and skeletal muscle were also performed to identify signatures associated with frailty and age-dependent functional decline. Our findings indicate that the decline in gait speed as a function of age and frailty is associated with dramatic increases in the energetic cost of physical activity and decreases in working capacity. Aging and functional decline prompt organs to rewire their substrate selection and metabolism towards redox-related pathways, mainly in liver and heart. Collectively, the data provide a framework to further understand and characterize processes of aging at the individual and organ levels.

Hence, there is a critical need for a non-invasive diagnostic assay. RCC is a disease of altered cellular metabolism with the tumor(s) in close proximity to the urine in the kidney suggesting metabolomic profiling would be an excellent choice for assay development. Here, we applied liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and machine learning (ML) for the discovery of candidate metabolic panels for RCC. The study cohort consists of 82 RCC patients and 174 healthy controls, these were separated into two sub-cohorts: model cohort and the test cohort. Discriminatory metabolic features were selected in the model cohort, using univariate, wrapper, and embedded methods of feature selection. Three ML techniques with different induction biases were used for training and hyperparameter tuning. Final assessment of RCC status prediction was made using the test cohort with the selected biomarkers and the tuned ML algorithms. A seven-metabolite panel consisting of endogenous and exogenous metabolites enabled the prediction of RCC with 88% accuracy, 94% sensitivity, and 85% specificity in the test cohort, with an AUC of 0.98.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001092	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8JM5Z			Lipid Profiling of Mouse Intestinal Organoids for studying APC Mutations	Inactivating mutations including both germline and somatic mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene drives most familial and sporadic colorectal cancers. Understanding the metabolic implications of this mutation will aid to establish its wider impact on cellular behaviour and potentially inform clinical decisions. However, to date, alterations in lipid metabolism induced by APC mutations remain unclear. Intestinal organoids have gained widespread popularity in studying colorectal cancer and chemotherapies, because their three-dimensional structure more accurately mimics an in vivo environment. Here, we aimed to investigate intra-cellular lipid disturbances induced by APC gene mutations in intestinal organoids using a reversed-phase ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (RP-UHPLC-MS)-based lipid profiling method. Lipids of the organoids grown from either wildtype (WT) or mice with Apc mutations (Lgr5–EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 Apcfl/fl) were extracted and analysed using RP-UHPLC-MS. Concentrations of phospholipids (e.g. PC(16:0/16:0), PC(18:1/20:0), PC(38:0), PC(18:1/22:1)), ceramides (e.g. Cer(d18:0/22:0), Cer(d42:0), Cer(d18:1/24:1)) and hexosylceramide (e.g. HexCer(d18:1/16:0), HexCer(d18:1/22:0)) were higher in Apcfl/fl organoids, whereas levels of sphingomyelins (e.g. SM(d18:1/14:0), SM(d18:1/16:0) ) were lower compared to WT. These observations indicate that cellular metabolism of sphingomyelin was upregulated, resulting in the cellular accumulation of ceramides and production of HexCer due to the absence of Apcfl/fl in the organoids. Our observations demonstrated lipid profiling of organoids and provided an enhanced insight into the effects of the APC mutations on lipid metabolism, making for a valuable addition to screening options of the organoid lipidome.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001093	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8DT31			Oxylipin biosynthesis reinforces cellular senescence through a RAS/p53 feedback loop and allows detection of senolysis	Cellular senescence is a stress or damage response that causes a permanent proliferative arrest and secretion of numerous factors with potent biological activities. This senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) has been characterized largely for secreted proteins that participate in embryogenesis, wound healing, inflammation and many age-related pathologies. By contrast, lipid components of the SASP are understudied. We show that senescent cells activate the biosynthesis of several oxylipins that promote segments of the SASP and reinforce the proliferative arrest. Notably, senescent cells synthesize and accumulate an unstudied intracellular prostaglandin, 1a,1b-dihomo-15-deoxy-delta-12,14-prostaglandin J2. Released 15-deoxy-delta-12,14-prostaglandin J2 is a biomarker of senolysis in culture and in vivo. This and other prostaglandin D2-related lipids promote the senescence arrest and SASP by activating RAS signaling. These data identify an important aspect of cellular senescence and a method to detect senolysis.

Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 alters host cell metabolism could lead to potential treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we profile metabolic changes conferred by SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney epithelial cells and lung air-liquid interface cultures and show that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases glucose carbon entry into the TCA cycle via increased pyruvate carboxylase expression. SARS-CoV-2 also reduces host cell oxidative glutamine metabolism while maintaining reductive carboxylation. Consistent with these changes in host cell metabolism, we show that SARS-CoV-2 increases activity of mTORC1, a master regulator of anabolic metabolism, in cell lines and patient lung stem cell-derived airway epithelial cells. We also show evidence of mTORC1 activation in COVID-19 patient lung tissue. Notably, mTORC1 inhibitors reduce viral replication in kidney epithelial cells and patient-derived lung stem cell cultures. This suggests that targeting mTORC1 could be a useful antiviral strategy for SARS-CoV-2 and treatment strategy for COVID-19 patients, although further studies are required to determine the mechanism of inhibition and potential efficacy in patients.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001095	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85976			Metabolomic signatures of NAFLD	Background and Aims: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a progressive liver disease that is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes. Accurate, non-invasive diagnostic tests to delineate the different stages: degree of steatosis, grade of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and stage fibrosis represent an unmet medical need. In our previous studies, we successfully identified specific serum molecular lipid signatures which associate with the amount of liver fat as well as with NASH. Here we report underlying associations between clinical data, lipidomic profiles, metabolic profiles and clinical outcomes, including downstream identification of potential biomarkers for various stages of the disease. Method: We leverage several statistical and machine-learning approaches to analyse clinical, lipidomic and metabolomic profiles of individuals from the European Horizon 2020 project: Elucidating Pathways of Steatohepatitis (EPoS). We interrogate data on patients representing the full spectrum of NAFLD/NASH derived from the EPoS European NAFLD Registry (n = 627). We condense the EPoS lipidomic data into lipid clusters and subsequently apply non-rejection-rate-pruned partial correlation network techniques to facilitate network analysis between the datasets of lipidomic, metabolomic and clinical data. For biomarker identification, a random forest ensemble classification approach was used to both search for valid disease biomarkers and to compare classification performance of lipids, metabolites and clinical factors in combination. Results: We found that steatosis and fibrosis grades were strongly associated with (1) an increase of triglycerides with low carbon number and double bond count as well as (2) a decrease of specific phospholipids, including lysophosphatidylcholines. In addition to the network topology as a result itself, we also present lipid clusters (LCs) of interest to the derived network of proposed interactions in our NAFLD data from the EPoS cohort, along with preliminary metabolite and lipid biomarkers to classify NAFLD fibrosis. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that dysregulation of lipid metabolism in progressive stages of NAFLD is reflected in circulation and may thus hold diagnostic value as well as offer new insights about NAFLD pathogenesis. Using this cohort as a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate current progress in tuning the accuracy random forest approaches with a view to predicting various subtypes of NAFLD patient using a minimal set of lipidomic and metabolic markers. For the first time, a detailed network-based picture emerges between lipids, polar metabolites and clinical variables. Lipidomic / metabolomic markers may provide an alternative method of NAFLD patient classification and risk stratification to guide therapy.

However, the strong intraspecific competition at the higher planting densities resulted in stress as well as the accumulation of antioxidants (gentiobiose, oxalic acid, dehydroascorbic acid) and other stress resistance-related metabolites. Interestingly, the planting at low densities with low intraspecific competition disturbed normal carbohydrate metabolism by upregulating galactose metabolism.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001102	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8840R			Fecal Metabolomics	Proteases constitute the largest enzyme gene family in vertebrates with intracellular and secreted proteases having critical roles in cellular and organ physiology. Intestinal tract contains diverse set of proteases mediating digestion, microbial responses, epithelial and immune signaling. Transit of chyme through the intestinal tract results in significant suppression of proteases. Although endogenous protease inhibitors have been identified, the broader mechanisms underlying protease regulation in the intestinal tract remains unclear. The objective of this study was to determine microbial regulation of proteolytic activity in intestinal tract using phenotype of post-infection irritable bowel syndrome, a condition characterized by high fecal proteolytic activity. Proteases of host pancreatic origin (chymotrypsin like pancreatic elastase 2A, 3B and trypsin 2) drove proteolytic activity. Of the 14 differentially abundant taxa, high proteolytic activity state was characterized by complete absence of the commensal Alistipes putredinis. Germ free mice had very high proteolytic activity (10-fold of specific-pathogen free mice) which dropped significantly upon humanization with microbiota from healthy volunteers. In contrast, high proteolytic activity microbiota failed to inhibit it, a defect that corrected with fecal microbiota transplant as well as addition of A. putredinis. These mice also had increased intestinal permeability similar to that seen in patients. Microbiota ß-glucuronidases mediate bilirubin deconjugation and unconjugated bilirubin is an inhibitor of serine proteases. We found that high proteolytic activity patients had lower urobilinogen levels, a product of bilirubin deconjugation. Mice colonized with ß-glucuronidase overexpressing E. coli demonstrated significant inhibition of proteolytic activity and treatment with ß-glucuronidase inhibitors increased it. The findings establish that specific commensal microbiota mediates effective inhibition of host pancreatic proteases and maintains intestinal barrier function through the production of ß-glucuronidases. This suggests an important homeostatic role for commensal intestinal microbiota.

A close relative, Cherax cainii, has almost completely displaced C. tenuimanus in the wild and is a successful aquaculture species, whereas C. tenuimanus has performed poorly in captivity. We used untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to obtain metabolomic profiles of female and male C. tenuimanus held in controlled aquarium conditions during their reproductive period. Using repeated haemolymph sampling we tracked the metabolomic profiles of animals just prior to and for a period of up to 34 days after pairing with a similar sized potential mate. We identified 54 reproducible annotated metabolites including amino acids, fatty acids, biogenic amines, purine and pyrimidine metabolites and excretion metabolites. Hierarchical clustering analysis distinguished five metabolite clusters. Principal component-canonical variate analysis clearly distinguished females from males, both unpaired and paired; similar trends in profile changes in both sexes after pairing; and a striking shift in males upon pairing. We discuss three main patterns of metabolomic responses: differentiation between sexes; reactive responses to the disturbance of pairing; and convergent response to the disturbance of pairing for males. Females generally had higher concentrations of metabolites involved in metabolic rate, mobilisation of energy stores and stress. Responses to the disturbance of pairing were also related to elevated stress. Females were mobilising lipid stores to deposit yolk, whereas males had a rapid and strong response to pairing, with shifts in metabolites associated with gonad development and communication, indicating males could complete reproductive readiness only once paired with a female. The metabolomic profiles support a previously proposed potential mechanism for displacement of C. tenuimanus by C. cainii in the wild and identify several biomarkers for testing hypotheses regarding reproductive success using targeted metabolomics.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001108	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8GM5B			Mitochondrial ATP fuels ABC transporter-mediated drug efflux in cancer chemoresistance	Chemotherapy remains the standard of care for most cancers worldwide, however development of chemoresistance due to the presence of the drug-effluxing ABC transporters remains a significant problem. The development of safe and effective means to overcome chemoresistance is critical for achieving durable remissions in many cancer patients. We have investigated the energetic demands of ABC transporters in the context of the metabolic adaptations of chemoresistant cancer cells. Here we show that ABC transporters use mitochondrial-derived ATP as a source of energy to efflux drugs out of cancer cells. We further demonstrate that the loss of MCJ (DnaJC15), an endogenous negative regulator of mitochondrial respiration, in chemoresistant cancer cells boosts their ability to produce ATP from mitochondria and fuel ABC transporters. We have developed novel MCJ mimetics that can attenuate mitochondrial respiration and safely overcome chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo. Administration of MCJ mimetics in combination with standard chemotherapeutic drugs could therefore become an new strategy for treatment of multiple cancers.

We refer to this multidimensional dataset as the COVIDome. We then created the COVIDome Explorer, an online researcher portal where the data can be analyzed and visualized in real time. We illustrate here the use of the COVIDome dataset through a multi-omics analysis of biosignatures associated with C-reactive protein (CRP), an established marker of poor prognosis in COVID-19, revealing associations between CRP levels and damage-associated molecular patterns, depletion of protective serpins, and mitochondrial metabolism dysregulation. We expect that the COVIDome Explorer will rapidly accelerate data sharing, hypothesis testing, and discoveries worldwide.

Two MS platforms (QExactive; Orbitrap Fusion Lumos) were used in various acquisition modes (DDA, Acquire X, PRM) to allow for the high lipid identification rates. Subsequently the global lipidome of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue of lean and obese individuals was quantified by MS (full MS on QExactive in positive and negative polarity and PRM in positive polarity).
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001114	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8Q39V			Regulation of stress signalling by SCD1-derived phosphatidylinositols	Cytotoxic stress activates stress-activated kinases, initiates adaptive mechanisms, including the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and induces programmed cell death. Fatty acid unsaturation, controlled by stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)1, prevents cytotoxic stress but the mechanisms are diffuse. We found that 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1’-myo-inositol) [PI(18:1/18:1)] is a SCD1-derived signaling lipid, which inhibits p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, counteracts UPR, autophagy and apoptosis induction, and maintains cell morphology and proliferation. SCD1 expression and the cellular PI(18:1/18:1) proportion decrease during the onset of cell death, thereby activating stress signaling. This counter-regulation applies to mechanistically diverse death-inducing conditions and occurs in tissues of Scd1-defective mice.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001116	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8FM51			The Role of Intestinal-derived FGF15 and Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy on Plasma Bile Acid Composition in Mice	Bariatric surgeries such as the Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (VSG) are invasive but provide the most effective long-term metabolic improvements in individuals with obesity and/or Type 2 diabetes. These powerful effects of manipulating the gastrointestinal tract point to an important role of gastrointestinal signals in regulating both energy balance and metabolism. To that end, we have used mouse models of VSG to identify key gut signals that mediate these beneficial effects. Previous data from our rodent model of VSG led us to hypothesize a potential role for the hormone Fibroblast-Growth Factor15/19 (mouse/human ortholog) which pharmacologically can regulate many aspects of energy homeostasis and glucose handling. FGF15 is expressed in ileal enterocytes of the small intestine and is released postprandially. Like many other gut hormones, postprandial plasma concentrations of the human ortholog FGF19 and ileal FGF15 expression in mice increase after VSG. We generated intestinal-specific FGF15 knock out (VilCreERT2; Fgf15f/f) mice and controls, which were maintained on 60% high-fat diet. VSG resulted in increased plasma bile acid levels. However, intestinal-specific FGF15 knock out mice had considerably higher levels of circulating total and hydrophobic bile acids after VSG. Unlike what we had predicted, intestinal-specific FGF15 knock out mice lost more weight after VSG as a result of increased lean tissue loss compared to control mice. Further, the loss of bone mineral density and bone marrow adipose tissue observed after VSG in control mice was even greater in intestinal-specific FGF15 knock out mice, perhaps secondary to anemia and elevated erythropoietin/FGF23. Finally the effect of VSG to improve glucose tolerance and to reduce hepatic cholesterol was also absent in intestinal-specific FGF15 knock out mice. These data point to an important role for intestinal FGF15 to protect the organism from deleterious effects of bile acid toxicity after VSG.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001117	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M89X2R			X13CMS: Global Tracking of Isotopic Labels in Untargeted Metabolomics	Studies of isotopically labeled compounds have been fundamental to understanding metabolic pathways and fluxes. They have traditionally, however, been used in conjunction with targeted analyses that identify and quantify a limited number of labeled downstream metabolites. Here we describe an alternative workflow that leverages recent advances in untargeted metabolomic technologies to track the fates of isotopically labeled metabolites in a global, unbiased manner. This untargeted approach can be applied to discover novel biochemical pathways and characterize changes in the fates of labeled metabolites as a function of altered biological conditions such as disease. To facilitate the data analysis, we introduce X13CMS, an extension of the widely used mass spectrometry-based metabolomic software package XCMS. X13CMS uses the XCMS platform to detect metabolite peaks and perform retention-time alignment in liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) data. With the use of the XCMS output, the program then identifies isotopologue groups that correspond to isotopically labeled compounds. The retrieval of these groups is done without any a priori knowledge besides the following input parameters: (i) the mass difference between the unlabeled and labeled isotopes, (ii) the mass accuracy of the instrument used in the analysis, and (iii) the estimated retention-time reproducibility of the chromatographic method. Despite its name, X13CMS can be used to track any isotopic label. Additionally, it detects differential labeling patterns in biological samples collected from parallel control and experimental conditions. We validated the ability of X13CMS to accurately retrieve labeled metabolites from complex biological matrices both with targeted LC/MS/MS analysis of a subset of the hits identified by the program and with labeled standards spiked into cell extracts. We demonstrate the full functionality of X13CMS with an analysis of cultured rat astrocytes treated with uniformly labeled (U-)13C-glucose during lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Our results show that out of 223 isotopologue groups enriched from U-13C-glucose, 95 have statistically significant differential labeling patterns in astrocytes challenged with LPS compared to unchallenged control cells. Only two of these groups overlap with the 32 differentially regulated peaks identified by XCMS, indicating that X13CMS uncovers different and complementary information from untargeted metabolomic studies. Like XCMS, X13CMS is implemented in R. It is available from our laboratory website at http://pattilab.wustl.edu/x13cms.php
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001118	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M86404			Metabolomic profiling of the rat hippocampus across developmental ages and after learning.	The metabolic mechanisms underlying the formation of early-life episodic memories remain poorly characterized. To fill this knowledge gap, we employed an untargeted metabolomic analysis in rats to determine how the hippocampal metabolome changes over the course of post-natal development under basal conditions and following inhibitory avoidance (IA) training, an aversive episodic event. We found that unique metabolomic profiles accompany learning at different ages. Subsequent biochemical and behavioral studies based on unique metabolomic regulations in the infant hippocampus established that infantile learning selectively recruits the glutathione-mediated antioxidant defenses for the formation of infantile memory.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001119	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M82D8P			Lung metabolomics after ischemic acute kidney injury reveals increased oxidative stress, altered energy production, and ATP depletion	Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex disease associated with increased mortality that may be due to deleterious distant organ effects. AKI associated with respiratory complications, in particular, has a poor outcome. In murine models, AKI is characterized by increased circulating cytokines, lung chemokine upregulation, and neutrophilic infiltration, similar to other causes of indirect acute lung injury (ALI)(e.g., sepsis). Many causes of lung inflammation are associated with a lung metabolic profile characterized by increased oxidative stress, a shift towards the use of other forms of energy production, and/or a depleted energy state. To our knowledge, there are no studies that have evaluated pulmonary energy production and metabolism after AKI. We hypothesized that based on the parallels between inflammatory acute lung injury and AKI-mediated lung injury, a similar metabolic profile would be observed. Lung metabolomics and ATP levels were assessed 4 hours, 24 hours, and 7 days after ischemic AKI in mice. Numerous novel findings regarding the effect of AKI on the lung were observed including 1) increased oxidative stress, 2) a shift toward alternate methods of energy production, and 3) depleted levels of ATP. The findings in this report bring to light novel characteristics of AKI-mediated lung injury and provide new leads into the mechanisms by which AKI in patients predisposes to pulmonary complications.

GUT-103 and GUT-108, live biotherapeutic products rationally designed to complement missing or underrepresented functions in the dysbiotic microbiome of IBD patients, address upstream targets, rather than targeting a single cytokine to block downstream inflammation responses. GUT-103, composed of 17 strains that synergistically provide protective and sustained engraftment in the IBD inflammatory environment, prevented, and treated chronic immune-mediated colitis. Therapeutic application of GUT-108 reversed established colitis in a humanized chronic T cell-mediated mouse model. It decreased pathobionts while expanding resident protective bacteria; produced metabolites promoting mucosal healing and immunoregulatory responses; decreased inflammatory cytokines and Th-1 and Th-17 cells; and induced interleukin-10-producing colonic regulatory cells, and IL-10-independent homeostatic pathways. We propose GUT-108 for treating and preventing relapse for IBD and other inflammatory conditions characterized by unbalanced microbiota and mucosal permeability.

Metabolic disease is associated with gut microbiome composition outside the context of HIV but has not been deeply explored in HIV infection nor in high-risk men who have sex with men (HR-MSM), who have a highly altered gut microbiome composition. Furthermore, the contribution of increased bacterial translocation and associated systemic inflammation that has been described in HIV-positive and HR-MSM individuals has not been explored. We used a multi-omic approach to explore relationships between gut microbes, immune phenotypes, diet, and metabolic health across ART-treated PLWH with and without LD; untreated PLWH; and HR-MSM. For PLWH on ART, we further explored associations with the plasma metabolome.

However, several sRNAs have been reported to also contain an open reading frame and thus are considered dual-function regulators. We discovered a dual-function regulator from Vibrio cholerae, called VcdRP, harboring a 29 amino acid protein (VcdP), as well as a base-pairing sequence. In this study, we measured the metabolite abundance of glycolytic and citric acid cycle intermediates using LC-MS.

While emerging studies support that microbiota regulates brain function with a few molecular cues suggested, the overall biochemical landscape of the “microbiota-gut-brain axis” remains largely unclear. Using high coverage metabolomics, we profiled feces, blood sera and cerebral cortical brain tissues of germ-free C57BL/6 mice and their age-matched conventionally raised counterparts. Results revealed for all three sample matrices metabolomic signatures owing to microbiota, yielding hundreds of identified metabolites including 533 altered for feces, 231 for sera and 58 for brain tissues with numerous significantly enriched pathways involving aromatic amino acids and neurotransmitters. Multicompartmental comparative analyses singled out microbiota-derived metabolites potentially implicated in interorgan transport and the gut-brain axis, exemplified by indoxyl sulfate and trimethylamine-N-oxide. Gender-specific characteristics of these landscapes were discussed. Our findings may be valuable for future research probing microbial influences on host metabolism and gut-brain communication.

We sacrificed and collected plasma from >=3 mice per strain per day of acute infection alongside uninfected control mice (approximately days 5-12 depending on mouse strain). We collected disease severity data, e.g. weight loss, liver enzymes, and anemia, concurrently. Together, these data enable 1) a picture of strain-specific and conserved metabolic responses during acute malaria, and 2) a comparison between metabolic responses and disease severity.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001131	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8HD7B			Comparison of High-Resolution Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry Platforms for Metabolite Annotation (part I)	Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) and Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) are among the highest-performing analytical platforms in metabolomics. Their high mass measurement accuracy and mass resolving power enable detailed investigation of biological metabolomes. Non-targeted MS experiments, however, yield extremely complex datasets that make metabolite annotation very challenging, if not impossible. High-resolution accurate mass measurements greatly facilitate this process by reducing mass errors and spectral overlaps. When applied together with relative isotopic abundance (RIA) measurements, heuristic rules, and constraints during searches, the number of candidate elemental formula(s) can be significantly reduced. Here, we evaluate the performance of two leading analytical MS platforms, Orbitrap ID-X and 12T solariX FT-ICR mass spectrometers, in terms of mass accuracy and RIA measurements, and how these factors affect the assignment of the correct elemental formulae in metabolite annotation. Quality of the mass measurements was evaluated under various experimental conditions (resolution: 120 K, 240 K, 500 K; automatic gain control: 5e4, 1e5, 5e5) for the Orbitrap MS platform.

The objective of this project was to investigate the metabolomic changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in response to endurance exercise. Young adult volunteers were enrolled, and the participants completed a monitored outdoor 90-minute run. CSF samples were collected during rest (Pre), and 60 minutes after the run (Post). Broad-spectrum targeted metabolomics was conducted using the liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This study provided insights into the neuroprotective and mental health benefits of endurance exercise.

We obtained metabolic profiles for wildtype and 16 mutants affecting the yeast glucose sensing pathway, comparing 0.05% glucose vs 10 min after glucose addition to 2%. First, we determined that the G protein-coupled receptor (Gpr1/Gpa2) directs early events in glucose utilization while the transceptors (Snf3/Rgt2) regulate subsequent processes and downstream products of glucose metabolism. Whereas the large G protein transmits the signal from its cognate receptor, Ras2 (but not Ras1) integrates responses from both receptor pathways. Second, we determined the relative contributions of the G protein a (Gpa2) and ß (Asc1) subunits to glucose-initiated processes. We determined that Gpa2 is primarily involved in regulating carbohydrate metabolism while Asc1 is primarily involved in amino acid metabolism. Both proteins are involved in regulating purine metabolism. Collectively, our analysis reveals the molecular basis for glucose detection and the earliest events of glucose-dependent signal transduction in yeast.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001136	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8VQ4D			A scalable workflow for the human exposome	Complementing the genome with an understanding of the human exposome is an important challenge for contemporary science and technology. Tens of thousands of chemicals are used in commerce, yet cost for targeted environmental chemical analysis limits surveillance to a few hundred known hazards. To overcome limitations which prevent scaling to thousands of chemicals, we developed a single-step express liquid extraction (XLE), gas chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) analysis and computational pipeline to operationalize the human exposome. We show that the workflow supports quantification of environmental chemicals in human plasma (200 µL) and tissue (= 100 mg) samples. The method also provides high resolution, sensitivity and selectivity for exposome epidemiology of mass spectral features without a priori knowledge of chemical identity. The simplicity of the method can facilitate harmonization of environmental biomonitoring between laboratories and enable population level human exposome research with limited sample volume.

LDR exposures can have different effects compared to acute high-dose rate exposures from a health and biodosimetry perspective. In this study, a novel irradiation system, VAriable Dose-rate External 137Cs irradiatoR (VADER), was used to expose male and female mice to a variable LDR over a 30-day time span to cumulative doses of 1 (only in males), 2, 2.8, 4.1, 8.8 (only in males), or 9.7 Gy to simulate fall-out type exposures. Urine and serum from mice exposed to an acute dose (~0.8 Gy/min) of x-rays were collected in parallel.

Decomposition of lignin-rich wood by fungi drives nutrient recycling in woodland ecosystems. Fluctuating abiotic conditions are known to promote the functioning of ecological communities and ecosystems. In the context of wood decay, fluctuating temperature increases decomposition rates. Metabolomics, in tandem with other ‘omics tools, can highlight the metabolic processes affected by experimental treatments, even in the absence of genome sequences and annotations. Globally, natural wood decay communities are dominated by the phylum Basidiomycota. We examined the metabolic responses of Mucidula mucida, a dominant constituent of pioneer communities in beech branches in British woodlands, and Exidia glandulosa, a stress-selected constituent of the same communities, in response to constant and diurnally cycling temperature. 2. We applied untargeted metabolomics and proteomics to beech wood blocks, colonised by M. mucida or E. glandulosa and exposed to either diurnally cycling (mean 15 ± 10°C) or constant (15°C) temperature, in a fully factorial design. 3. Metabolites and proteins linked to lignin breakdown, the citric acid cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and protein biosynthesis and turnover were under-enriched in fluctuating, compared to stable temperatures, in the generalist M. mucida. Conversely E. glandulosa showed little differential response to the experimental treatments. 4. Synthesis. By demonstrating temperature dependant metabolic signatures related to nutrient acquisition in a generalist wood decay fungus, we provide new insights into how abiotic conditions can affect community-mediated decomposition and carbon turnover in forests. We show that mechanisms underpinning important biogeochemical processes can be highlighted using untargeted metabolomics and proteomics in the absence of well-annotated genomes.

To further explore metabolic impacts, we determined LCO’s effects on model organism Daphnia magna using untargeted metabolomics. Our results show a sublethal 1 mg/L 48 h LCO exposure causes significant impacts on D. magna metabolites, while ion control exposure equivalent to released Li and Co had no impact, showing the nano-specificity of LCO impacts. Specifically, metabolomic analysis indicated alteration of metabolites related to amino acid metabolism and starch, sucrose, and galactose metabolism as a result of LCO exposure.

Young and old C57BL/6 male mice were assigned to either a sedentary or two types of exercise regimes consisting of daily high-intensity intermittent (HIIT) or moderate intensity continuous (MICT) training for 4 weeks, compatible with the older group’s exercise capacity. Body composition, fasting blood glucose levels, and muscle strength were improved in exercised old mice compared to sedentary controls, while the exercise benefits were absent in younger animals. Skeletal muscle exhibited structural and functional adaptations in response to exercise, as revealed by electron microscopy, OXPHOS assays, respirometry, and PGC-1? and LC3-II protein levels. Transcriptomics analysis of gastrocnemius muscle combined with liver and serum metabolomics unveiled an age-dependent metabolic remodeling provoked by exercise through mitochondrial biogenesis, energy metabolism, and cellular plasticity. These results are supportive of a tailored exercise prescription approach with the goal of improving health and ameliorating age-associated loss of muscle mass, strength and function in the elderly.

Here, middle-aged mice were maintained for 5 months on 4:10 feeding cycles, consisting of 4 days of very low-calorie intake (VLCI) achieved with either standard laboratory chow (SD) or a fasting mimicking diet (FMD), followed by 10 days of ad libitum access to SD. Fat and lean mass loss was accompanied with improved performance, glucoregulation, and metabolic flexibility independent of diet composition. However, only the 4:10/SD cycles elicited a long-lasting metabolomic reprograming in serum and liver that was preserved six days after refeeding. Challenged with an obesogenic diet, cycles of VLCI achieved with either high-fat diet (HFD) or FMD during the low-calorie period did not prevent diet-induced obesity nor did they elicited a long-lasting metabolic memory, despite achieving modest metabolic flexibility. Our results highlight the importance of diet composition in mediating the metabolic benefits of short cycles of VLCI.

PTN expression levels are upregulated in the nigrostriatal pathway of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients. We aimed to characterize the dopaminergic injury and glial activation in the nigrostriatal pathway of mice with transgenic Ptn overexpression in the brain (Ptn-Tg) after intrastriatal injection of the Parkinsonian toxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). The injection of 6-OHDA induced a significant decrease of the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the substantia nigra and of the striatal TH contents in Wild type (Wt) mice. In contrast, these effects of 6-OHDA were blocked in Ptn-Tg mice. 6-OHDA injection did not cause robust changes in microglia but induced an exacerbated astrocytic response in Wt mice compared with Ptn-Tg mice. In metabolomics studies, we detected interesting metabolites that significantly discriminate the more injured 6-OHDA-injected Wt striatum and the more protected 6-OHDA-injected Ptn-Tg striatum. Particularly, we detected groups of metabolites, mostly corresponding to phospholipids, whose trends were opposite in both groups. In summary, the data confirm the neuroprotective effect of brain PTN overexpression in this mouse model of PD. New lipid-related PD drug candidates emerge from this study and the data presented here support the increasingly recognized “lipid cascade” in PD.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001145	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8Q12H			Evidence that class I glutamine amidotransferase, GAT1_2.1, acts as a glutaminase in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana	Carbon and Nitrogen balance in plant leaves, required for sustained growth, is achieved by inter-relationships between the processes of photosynthesis, respiration and amino acid metabolism in a photoperiod dependent manner. The GS/GOGAT cycle is one such mechanism and is highly elucidated in plants to serve as a crossroad between C and N metabolism. Non-photosynthetic tissues (e.g., roots, germinating seeds), however, lack a sufficient supply of carbon skeletons under high N conditions and hence may resort to other mechanisms, along with GS/GOGAT cycle, to achieve the aforementioned C/N balance. Here, we propose a potential role of an enzyme, GAT1_2.1, in hydrolyzing excess glutamine to Glu, which channels carbon skeletons to the TCA cycle, under high N conditions, using Arabidopsis as a model. GAT1_2.1, a class I glutamine amidotrasferase of unknown substrate specificity, was shown to be highly responsive to N status, localized in mitochondria and is highly co-expressed with Glutamate Dehydrogenase 2 (GDH2). Arabidopsis mutants lacking GAT1_2.1 have elevated GABA shunt pathway activity to replenish the depleted levels of Glu. This Glu may then be deaminated to 2-oxoglutarate by GDH2 and channeled into the TCA cycle thus providing a crossroad between C and N metabolism in root mitochondria. We use a metabolomics approach to demonstrate the difference in quantities of pathway intermediates between wild type Arabidopsis roots and gat1_2.1 mutants using glutamine as organic nitrogen treatment and KNO3 and Glu treatments as negative and positive controls, respectively. In addition, we used Arabidopsis root extracts, spiked with amide nitrogen labeled (15N1) Glutamine and a purified recombinant protein, both full length and glutaminase domain only versions, to determine the amido group acceptor, if any, in the glutamine amidotransferase reaction.

We used a multiplatform untargeted metabolomics-based approach to uncover the biochemical remodeling induced by PD in a really early and pre-symptomatic stage and unveiling early potential diagnostic biomarkers. Baseline pre-clinical plasma samples (Pre-PD n=39; control group n=39) were obtained from the European Prospective Study on Nutrition and Cancer (EPIC) cohort, which healthy volunteers were followed for around 15 years to ascertain incident PD. Our finding revealed alterations in fatty acids metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and gut-brain axis dysregulation. This study is of inestimable value since this is the first study conducted with samples collected many years before the disease development.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001150	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M82690			APOE4-associated differences in lipidomics signatures in mouse brain and cultured neurons	Apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE4) is the primary genetic risk factor for the late-onset form of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the reason for this association is not completely understood, researchers have uncovered numerous effects of APOE4 expression on AD-relevant brain processes, including amyloid beta (Aß) accumulation, lipid metabolism, endosomal-lysosomal processing and bioenergetics. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of APOE4 allelic dosage on regional brain lipid composition in aged mice, as well as in cultured neurons. We performed a targeted lipidomic analysis on the entorhinal cortex (EC) and primary visual cortex (PVC) from 14–15 month-old APOE3/3, APOE3/4, and APOE4/4 targeted replacement mice, as well as on WT neurons cultured with conditioned media from APOE3/3 or APOE4/4 astrocytes. Our results reveal that the EC possesses increased susceptibility to APOE4-associated lipid alterations compared to the PVC. In the EC, APOE4 expression showed a dominant effect in decreasing diacylglycerol (DAG) levels, and a semi-dominant additive effect in the upregulation of multiple ceramide, glycosylated sphingolipid and bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate (BMP) species, lipids known to accumulate as a result of endosomal-lysosomal dysfunction and defective lysosomal clearance. Neurons treated with conditioned media from APOE4 vs. APOE3 astrocytes also showed similar alterations of DAG and BMP species as those observed in the mouse EC. Our results suggest that APOE4 expression differentially modulates regional and neuronal lipid signatures, which may underlie the increased susceptibility of EC-localized neurons to AD pathology.

This matched, case-controlled study compared the fecal microbiome and metabolome in hospitalized horses on antibiotics that developed diarrhea (AAD), hospitalized horses on antibiotics that did not develop diarrhea (ABX) and a healthy, non-hospitalized control population (CON). Naturally-voided fecal samples were collected from AAD horses (n=17) the day that diarrhea developed and matched to ABX (n=15) and CON (n=31) horses for diet, antimicrobial agent and duration of antimicrobial therapy (< 5 days or > 5 days). Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes on fecal DNA was performed. Alpha and beta diversity metrics were generated using QIIME 2.0. A Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s post-test and ANOSIM testing was used for statistical analysis. Microbiome composition in AAD was significantly different from CON (ANOSIM, R= 0.568, p=0.001) and ABX (ANOSIM, R=0.121, p=0.0012). Fecal samples were lyophilized and extracted using a solvent-based method. Untargeted metabolomics using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry platforms was performed. Metabolomic data was analyzed using Metaboanalyst 4.0 and Graphpad Prism v 7. Principal component analysis plots (PCA) were used to visualize the distribution of metabolites between groups. Heat maps were used to identify the relative concentrations amongst the most abundant 25 metabolites. A one-way ANOVA was used to compare differences in metabolites amongst the three groups of horses. Only named metabolites were included in the analysis. The microbiome of AAD and ABX horses had significantly decreased richness and evenness than CON horses (p<0.05). Actinobacteria (q=0.0192) and Bacteroidetes (q=0.0005) were different between AAD and CON. Verrucomicrobia was markedly decreased in AAD compared to ABX and CON horses (q=0.0005). Horses with AAD have a dysbiosis compared to CON horses, and show minor differences in bacterial community composition to ABX horses. Metabolite profiles of horses with AAD clustered separately from those with AAD or CON. Ten metabolites were found to be significantly different between groups (P<0.05) and are listed according to their metabolic pathway: amino acid metabolism (R-equol, L-tyrosine, kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid ) lipid metabolism (docosahexaenoic acid ethyl ester), biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (daidzein, isoquinoline) and two metabolites with unidentified pathways (1,3-divinyl-2-imidazolidinone, N-acetyltyramine).

Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality worldwide, and also greatly increases the risk of developing serious health complications in childhood and throughout life. Conditions that contribute to preterm birth remain largely unclear, though an influence by environmental exposures is suspected but poorly understood. In our preliminary work, we found that exposure to common chemicals, such as phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), may contribute to this serious but understudied public health problem. We also observed strong associations between phthalates/BPA and general markers of oxidative stress, and in turn between these general markers of oxidative stress and risk of preterm birth. In this nested case-control study within an ongoing cohort of pregnant women in Puerto Rico (PROTECT), we will explore untargeted lipidomics, as well as levels of eicosanoids specific to arachidonic acid oxidation pathways, in relation to both environmental exposures and preterm birth.

Experimental groups for rat experiments. 1)Rats in the ‘RYGB_Donor group’ underwent RYGB surgery. Postoperatively, animals received a two-choice diet, consisting of a SC and HFD. Once the animals recovered and achieved a stabilized weight reduction at 4 weeks postoperatively, body weight and food intake were recorded daily. 2)Rats allocated into the ‘RYGB_AB group’ were handled the same as animals in the ‘RYGB_donor group’. From postoperative week 4 onwards, animals received an antibiotic treatment (AB) consisting of ampicillin (1 g/l; Ratiopharm), vancomycin (0.5 g/l; Ratiopharm), neomycin (1 g/l; Bela-pharm), and metronidazole (1 g/l; CP-Pharma), provided freshly every day via drinking water.[19, 20] All antibiotics were given for the time period indicated in each figure.[21] 3)Rats in the ‘Lean group’ served as healthy, age-matched controls, constantly kept under SC. 4)Rats in the ‘Lean_AB group’ received the same antibiotic treatment as animals in the RYGB_AB group, serving as a control for antibiotic-specific side effects. All antibiotics were given for the time periods indicated in each figure. 5)Rats in the ‘DIO group’ received no surgery, but were otherwise handled like RYGB litter mates. 6)Rats in the ‘DIO_FMT_RYGB group’ received fecal RYGB_Donor microbiota transplantation once per week, but were otherwise handled like DIO litter mates. For fecal transplantation experiments, 100 mg of fresh stool from body weight-stabilized RYGB donors were re-suspended in 1 ml of PBS, homogenized carefully and administered via oral gavage with 200 µl of the suspension. 7)Rats in the ‘FMT_Lean group’ were handled like DIO litter mates, but were orally gavaged with 200 µl of filtrate received from lean donors, and served as a control for fecal transplantation and specificity of effect size(s) as a function of the donor microbiota. 8)Rats in the ‘DIO_PF_FMT group’ were handled like DIO litter mates, but pair-fed to the SC/HFD food intake of ‘FMT_Lean littermates, serving as a control for effects secondary to reduced caloric intake.

This has raised questions of whether plant-based meat alternatives represent proper nutritional replacements to animal meat. Given that food sources have considerable complexity and contain a wide variety of nutrients (e.g., phenols, anti-oxidants, peptides, amino acids, fatty acids, and other carboxylic acids), the majority of which do not appear on nutrition labels, it is important to explore expanded nutrient profiles when determining whether beef and plant-based meat alternatives are nutritionally interchangeable. Important nutritional differences may exist between beef and novel plant-based alternatives, given their materials origin; however, this has not been thoroughly assessed. Given the scientific and commercial interest in plant-based meat alternatives, the goal of our study was to use untargeted metabolomics to provide an in-depth comparison of the metabolite profiles of grass-fed ground beef and a popular plant-based meat alternative.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001159	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8WH6D			Use of Integrated Metabolomics, Transcriptomics, and Signal Protein Profile to Characterize the Effector Function and Associated Metabotype of Polarized Macrophage Phenotypes	Macrophages (MFs) display remarkable plasticity and the ability to activate diverse responses to a host of intracellular and external stimuli. Despite extensive characterization of M1 MFs and a broad set of M2 MFs, comprehensive characterization of functional phenotype and associated metabotype driving this diverse MF activation remains. Herein, we utilized an ex vivo model to produce six MF functional phenotypes. Isolated CD14+ PBMCs were differentiated into resting M0 MFs, and then polarized into M1 (IFN-?/LPS), M2a (IL-4/IL-13), M2b (IC/LPS), M2c (IL-10), and M2d (IL-6/LIF) MFs. The MFs were profiled using a bioanalyte matrix of four cell surface markers, ~50 secreted proteins, ~800 expressed myeloid genes, and ~450 identified metabolites relative to M0 MFs. Signal protein and expressed gene profiles grouped the MFs into inflammatory (M1 and M2b) and wound resolution (M2a, M2c, and M2d) phenotypes; however, each had a unique metabolic profile. While both M1 and M2b MFs shared metabotype profiles consistent with an inflammatory signature; key differences were observed in the TCA cycle, FAO, and OXPHOS. Additionally, M2a, M2c, and M2d MFs all profiled as tissue repair MFs; however, metabotype differences were observed in multiple pathways including hexosamine, polyamine, and fatty acid metabolism. These metabolic and other key functional distinctions suggest phagocytic and proliferative functions for M2a MFs, and angiogenesis and ECM assembly capabilities for M2b, M2c, and M2d MFs. By integrating metabolomics into a systems analysis of MF phenotypes, we provide the most comprehensive map of MF diversity to date, along with the global metabolic shifts that correlate to MF functional plasticity in these phenotypes.

With emerging evidence that disproves the immune privileged environment in the brain, there is much interest in examining various immunotherapy strategies to treat these incurable cancers. Unfortunately, to date, clinical studies investigating immunotherapy regimens have not provided much evidence of efficacy, leading to questions about the suitability of immunotherapy strategies for these tumors. Inadequate inherent populations of lymphocytes in tumor (TILs) and limited trafficking of systemic circulating T cells into the central nervous system (CNS) likely contribute to the poor response to immunotherapy treatment for primary CNS cancers. This paucity of TILs is in concert with the finding of epigenetic silencing of genes that promote immune cell movement (chemotaxis) to the tumor. In this study we evaluated the ability of GSK126, a blood-brain barrier permeable small molecule inhibitor of EZH2, to reverse the epigenetic silencing of chemokines like CXCL9 and CXCL10. When combined with anti-PD-1 treatment, these IFN driven chemokines promote T cell infiltration, resulting in decreased tumor growth and enhanced survival in immunocompetent murine sub-cutaneous and intracranial tumor syngeneic models of GBM. Examination of the tumor micro-environment revealed that the decrease in tumor growth in the mice treated with the drug combination was accompanied by increased tumor CD8 T cell infiltration along with higher IFN expression. Additionally, a significant increase in CXCR3+ T cells in the draining lymph nodes was also found. Taken together, our data suggests that in glioblastoma, epigenetic modulation using GSK126 could improve current immunotherapy strategies by reversing the epigenetic changes that enable immune cell evasion leading to enhanced immune c-ll trafficking to the tumor.

Natural products of land and sea, being conceived to be having fewer side effects, pose themselves as a welcome relief. In this respect, we have taken a scaffolded approach to unearthing the almost unexplored chemical constituents of Malaysian red seaweed, Gracilaria edulis. Essentially, a preliminary evaluation of the ethyl acetate and acetone solvent extracts, among a series of six such, revealed potential antibacterial activity against six MDR species namely, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, and Bacillus subtilis. Detailed analyses of the inlying chemical constituents, through LC-MS and GC-MS chromatographic separation, revealed a library of metabolic compounds. These were led for further virtual screening against selected key role playing proteins in the virulence of the aforesaid bacteria. To this end, detailed predictive pharmacological analyses added up to reinforce Eplerenone as a natural alternative from the plethora of plausible bioactives. Our work adds to the ongoing effort to re-discover and repurpose biochemical compounds to combat the antimicrobial resistance offered by the Gram-positive and the -negative bacterial species.

Naphthalene elicits region-specific toxicity in airway club cells through cytochrome P450 (P450)-mediated bioactivation, resulting in depletion of glutathione and subsequent cytotoxicity. While effects of naphthalene in mice have been extensively studied, few experiments have characterized global metabolomic changes in the lung. In individual lung regions, we found metabolomic changes in microdissected mouse lung conducting airways and parenchyma obtained from animals sacrificed 2, 6, and 24 hours following naphthalene treatment. Data on 577 unique identified metabolites were acquired by accurate mass spectrometry-based assays focusing on lipidomics and non-targeted metabolomics of hydrophilic compounds. Statistical analyses revealed distinct metabolite profiles between the two major lung regions. In addition, the number and magnitude of statistically significant exposure-induced changes in metabolite abundance were different between lung airways and parenchyma for unsaturated lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), dipeptides, purines, pyrimidines, and amino acids. Importantly, temporal changes were found to be highly distinct for male and female mice, with males exhibiting predominant treatment-specific changes only at two hours post-exposure. In females, metabolomic changes persisted until six hours post-naphthalene treatment, which may explain the previously characterized higher susceptibility of female mice to naphthalene toxicity. In both males and females, treatment-specific changes corresponding to lung remodeling, oxidative stress response, and DNA damage were observed, which may provide insights into potential mechanisms contributing to the previously reported effects of naphthalene exposure in the lung.

To aid in the prognostic classification of disease severity, we perform untargeted metabolomics on plasma from 339 patients, with samples collected at six longitudinal time points. Using the temporal metabolic profiles and machine learning, we build a predictive model of disease severity. We discover that a panel of metabolites measured at the time of study entry successfully determine disease severity. Through analysis of longitudinal samples, we confirm that the majority of these markers are directly related to disease progression and that their levels are restored to baseline upon disease recovery. Finally, we validate that these metabolites are also altered in a hamster model of COVID-19. Our results indicate that metabolic changes associated with COVID-19 severity can be effectively used to stratify patients and inform resource allocation during the pandemic.

Rafflesia species are threatened with extinction, making them an iconic symbol of plant conservation. Thus far, propagation has proved challenging, greatly decreasing efficacy of conservation efforts. This study compared the metabolites in the shoots of Rafflesia-infected and non-infected Tetrastigma loheri to examine how Rafflesia infection affects host metabolomics and elucidate the Rafflesia infection process. Results from LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics analysis showed benzylisoquinoline alkaloids were significantly elevated in non-infected shoots and are here reported for the first time in the genus Tetrastigma, and in the grape family, Vitaceae. These metabolites have been implicated in plant defense mechanisms and may prevent a Rafflesia infection. In Rafflesia-infected shoots, oxygenated fatty acids, or oxylipins, and a flavonoid, previously shown involved in plant immune response, were abundant. This study provides a preliminary assessment of metabolites that differ between Rafflesia-infected and non-infected Tetrastigma hosts and may have applications in Rafflesia propagation to meet conservation goals.

Damage to the renal vascular system and subsequent hypoxia are common contributors to both AKI and CKD. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is reported to protect the kidney from acute ischemic damage and a novel HIF stabilizer, FG4592 (Roxadustat), has become available in the clinic as an anti-anemia drug. However, the role of FG4592 in the AKI-to-CKD transition remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated the role of FG4592 in the AKI-to-CKD transition induced by unilateral kidney ischemia-reperfusion (UIR). The results showed that FG4592, given to mice 3 days after UIR, markedly alleviated kidney fibrosis and enhanced renal vascular regeneration, possibly via activating the HIF-1a/vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)/VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) signaling pathway and driving the expression of the endogenous antioxidant superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). In accordance with the improved renal vascular regeneration and redox balance, the metabolic disorders of the UIR mice kidneys were also attenuated by treatment with FG4592. However, the inflammatory response in the UIR kidneys was not affected significantly by FG-4592. Importantly, in the kidneys of CKD patients, we also observed enhanced HIF-1a expression which was positively correlated with the renal levels of VEGFA and SOD2. Together, these findings demonstrated the therapeutic effect of the anti-anemia drug FG-4592 in preventing the AKI-to-CKD transition related to ischemia and the redox imbalance.

(bioRxiv 2020.08.13.250142). The below is taken from the abstract: Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is an emerging technology that holds potential for improving clinical diagnosis, biomarker discovery, metabolomics research and pharmaceutical applications. The large data size and high dimensional nature of MSI pose computational and memory complexities that hinder accurate identification of biologically-relevant molecular patterns. We propose msiPL, a robust and generic probabilistic generative model based on a fully-connected variational autoencoder for unsupervised analysis and peak learning of MSI data. The method can efficiently learn and visualize the underlying non-linear spectral manifold, reveal biologically-relevant clusters of tumor heterogeneity and identify underlying informative m/z peaks. The method provides a probabilistic parametric mapping to allow a trained model to rapidly analyze a new unseen MSI dataset in a few seconds. The computational model features a memory-efficient implementation using a minibatch processing strategy to enable the analyses of big MSI data (encompassing more than 1 million high-dimensional datapoints) with significantly less memory. We demonstrate the robustness and generic applicability of the application on MSI data of large size from different biological systems and acquired using different mass spectrometers at different centers, namely: 2D Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT ICR) MSI data of human prostate cancer, 3D MALDI Time-of-Flight (TOF) MSI data of human oral squamous cell carcinoma, 3D Desorption Electrospray Ionization (DESI) Orbitrap MSI data of human colorectal adenocarcinoma, 3D MALDI TOF MSI data of mouse kidney, and 3D MALDI FT ICR MSI data of a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse brain model of glioblastoma.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001172	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M86T2S			Torsin and NEP1R1-CTDNEP1 affect interphase NPC insertion by lipid-dependent and -independent mechanisms	The interphase nuclear envelope is extensively remodeled during nuclear pore complex insertion. The process is relatively poorly understood, including why it requires the Torsin ATPases that also regulate NE-localized lipid metabolism. Here we show that fly dTorsin affects lipid metabolism through the NEP1R1-CTDNEP1 phosphatase/ Lipin phosphatidic acid phosphatase pathway. At a cellular level, fly and mouse Torsins removed NEP1R1-CTDNEP1 from the NE to, in turn, exclude Lipin from the nucleus. NEP1R1-CTDNEP1 downregulation also restored nuclear pore membrane fusion in post-mitotic dTorsinKO fat body cells. However, Lipin downregulation was ineffective and membrane fusion defects did not correlate with lipidomic abnormalities. Further testing confirmed that membrane fusion continued in cells with excess Lipin function. It also led to the surprising finding that excess PA metabolism inhibited recruitment of the inner ring complex Nup35 subunit, resulting in elongated channel-like structures in place of mature nuclear pores. We conclude that the NEP1R1-CTDNEP1 phosphatase affects interphase NPC biogenesis by lipid-dependent and lipid-independent mechanisms and this explains some of the pleiotropic effects of Torsins.

Cell-permeable esterified analogs are widely used to study the role of KG in governing bioenergetic and amino acid metabolism and DNA, RNA, and protein hydroxylation reactions, as cellular membranes are thought to be impermeable to KG. Here we show that esterified KG analogs rapidly hydrolyze in aqueous media, yielding KG that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, can be imported by many cell lines. Esterified KG analogs exhibit spurious KG-independent effects on cellular metabolism, including extracellular acidification, arising from rapid hydrolysis and de-protonation of a-ketoesters, and significant analog-specific inhibitory effects on glycolysis or mitochondrial respiration. In many cell lines, imported KG metabolizes to succinate in the cytosol, and we observe minimal KG utilization for mitochondrial metabolism in normal culture conditions. These findings demonstrate that nuclear and cytosolic KG-dependent reactions may derive KG from functionally distinct subcellular pools and sources.

Deeper molecular understanding of this dynamic physiological landscape is needed to define events which regulate the transition and entry into and exit from the E/M state. Here, we quantified >60,000 molecules across ten time points and twelve omic layers in human mammary epithelial cells undergoing TGFß-induced EMT. Deep proteomic profiles of whole cells, nuclei, extracellular vesicles, secretome, membrane and phosphoproteome defined state-specific signatures and major transition points. Parallel metabolomics showed metabolic reprogramming preceded changes in other layers, while single-cell RNA sequencing identified transcription factors controlling entry into E/M. Covariance analysis exposed unexpected discordance between the molecular layers. Integrative causal modeling revealed co-dependencies governing entry into E/M that were verified experimentally using combinatorial inhibition. Overall, this dataset provides an unprecedented resource on TGFß signaling, EMT and cancer.

Undernourished children display an overabundance of intestinal pathogens and pathobionts, and these bacteria induce enteric dysfunction in undernourished mice; however, the cause of their overgrowth remains poorly defined. Here, we show that disease-inducing human isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroidales spp. are capable of multi-species symbiotic cross-feeding, resulting in synergistic growth of a mixed community in vitro. Growth synergy occurs uniquely under malnourished conditions limited in protein and iron: in this context, Bacteroidales spp. liberate diet- and mucin-derived sugars and Enterobacteriaceae spp. enhance the bioavailability of iron. Analysis of human microbiota datasets reveals that Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae are strongly correlated in undernourished children, but not in adequately nourished children, consistent with a diet-dependent growth synergy in the human gut. Together these data suggest that dietary cross-feeding fuels the overgrowth of pathobionts in undernutrition.

Antiglycolytic therapies are under investigation for treatment of obesity, cancer, aging, autoimmunity, and microbial diseases. Interrupting glycolysis is highly valued as a therapeutic strategy, because glycolytic disruption is generally tolerated in mammals. Unfortunately, anemia is a known dose-limiting side effect of these inhibitors and presents a major caveat to development of antiglycolytic therapies. We developed specific inhibitors of enolase – a critical enzyme in glycolysis – and validated their metabolic and cellular effects on human erythrocytes. Enolase inhibition increases erythrocyte susceptibility to oxidative damage and induces rapid and premature erythrocyte senescence, rather than direct hemolysis. We apply our model of red cell toxicity to address questions regarding erythrocyte glycolytic disruption in the context of Plasmodium falciparum malaria pathogenesis. Our study provides a framework for understanding red blood cell homeostasis under normal and disease states and clarifies the importance of erythrocyte reductive capacity in malaria parasite growth.

However, sublethal hypoxia can trigger an adaptive response called hypoxic preconditioning. While prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD) enzymes and hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) have been identified as key elements of oxygen sensing machinery, the mechanisms by which hypoxic preconditioning protects against insults remain unclear. Here, we perform serum metabolomic profiling to assess alterations induced by hypoxic preconditioning.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001179	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M89M5S			Sodium dichloroacetate stimulates cardiac mitochondrial metabolism and improves cardiac conduction in the ovine fetus during labor	Previous studies in our laboratory have suggested that the increase in stillbirth in pregnancies complicated by chronic maternal stress or hypercortisolemia is associated with cardiac dysfunction in late stages of labor and delivery. Transcriptomics analysis of the overly represented differentially expressed genes in the fetal heart of hypercortisolemic ewes indicated involvement of mitochondrial function. Sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) has been used to improve mitochondrial function in several disease states. We hypothesized that administration of DCA to laboring ewes would improve both cardiac mitochondrial activity and cardiac function in their fetuses. Four groups of ewes and their fetuses were studied: control, cortisol-infused (1 g/kg/d from 115 to term; CORT), DCA-treated (over 24h) or DCA+CORT-treated; oxytocin was delivered starting 48h before the DCA treatment. DCA significantly decreased cardiac lactate, alanine and glucose/glucose-6-phosphate and increased acylcarnitine/isobutyryl-carnitine. DCA increased mitochondrial activity, increasing oxidative phosphorylation (PCI, PCI+II)) per tissue weight or per unit of citrate synthase. DCA also decreased the duration of the QRS, attenuating the prolongation of the QRS observed in CORT fetuses. The effect to reduce QRS duration with DCA treatment correlated with increased glycerophosphocholine and serine and decreased phophocholine after DCA treatment. There were negative correlations of acylcarnitine/isobutyryl-carnitine to both HR and MAP. These results suggest that improvements in mitochondrial respiration with DCA produced changes in the cardiac lipid metabolism that favor improved conduction in the heart. DCA may therefore be an effective treatment of fetal cardiac metabolic disturbances in labor that can contribute to impairments of fetal cardiac conduction.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001181	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M82418			Effects of Acute 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin Exposure on the Circulating and Cecal Metabolome Profile	2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a polyhalogenated planar hydrocarbon belonging to a group of highly toxic and persistent environmental contaminants known as “dioxins”. TCDD is an animal teratogen and carcinogen that is well characterized for causing immunosuppression through activation of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR). In the current study, we investigated the effect of exposure of mice to an acute dose of TCDD on the metabolic profile within the serum and cecal contents to better define the effects of TCDD on host physiology. Our findings demonstrated that within the circulating metabolome following acute TCDD, there was significant dysregulation in the metabolism of bioactive lipids, amino acids, and carbohydrates when compared to the VEH treated mice. These wide-spread changes in metabolite abundance were identified to regulate host immunity via modulating Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-?B) and Extracellular Signal-Regulated Protein Kinase (ERK1/2) activity, and work as biomarkers for a variety of organ injuries and dysfunctions that follow TCDD exposure. Within the cecal content, of mice exposed to TCDD, we were able to detect changes in inflammatory markers that regulate NF-?B, markers of injury-related inflammation, and changes in lysine degradation, nicotinamide metabolism, and butanoate metabolism, which suggested an immediate suppression microbial metabolism. Collectively, these results demonstrate that acute TCDD exposure results in immediate irregularities in the circulating and intestinal metabolome which likely contributes to TCDD toxicity and can be used as biomarkers for the early detection of individual exposure.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001182	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8XD6P			Metabolomics analysis of multiple samples	Liquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) is the most popular platform for untargeted metabolomics methods, but annotating LC-HRMS data is a long-standing bottleneck that we are facing since years ago in metabolomics research. A wide variety of methods have been established to deal with the annotation issue. To date, however, there is a scarcity of efficient, systematic, and easy-to-handle tools that are tailored for metabolomics and exposome community. Herein, we developed a user-friendly and powerful stand-alone software, MetEx, to enable implementation of classical peak detection-based annotation and a brand-new annotation method based on targeted extraction algorithms. Especially the newly proposed annotation method of targeted extraction can identify more than 2 times more metabolites than traditional peak detection-based annotation methods because it reduces the loss of metabolite signal in the data preprocessing process.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001183	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8SM4R			Targeted Sphingolipid analysis of HeLa knockout for expression of GRASP55	Golgi apparatus, the main glycosylation station of the cell, consists of a stack of discontinuous cisternae. Glycosylation enzymes are usually concentrated in one or two specific cisternae along the cis-trans axis of the organelle. How such compartmentalized localization of enzymes is achieved and how it contributes to glycosylation are not clear. Here we show that the Golgi matrix protein GRASP55 directs the compartmentalized localization of key enzymes involved in glycosphingolipid (GSL) biosynthesis. GRASP55 acts by binding to these enzymes and preventing their entry to COPI derived retrograde transport vesicles thus concentrating them in the trans-Golgi. In genome edited cells lacking GRASP55 the enzymes relocate to cis-Golgi. Here we evaluated the impact of deleting GRASP55 on sphingolipid composition of HeLa cells by targeted lipid analysis.

For phytoplankton, recognition and response to chemical cues from predators, as evidence of predation risk, is particularly crucial. The phytoplankton Alexandrium minutum upregulates its toxicity when exposed to copepodamides, a suite of compounds released by copepod predators. However, how A. minutum perceives these predatory cues and what metabolic pathways are involved in initiating toxin induction remains unknown. In this study LC/MS and NMR-based metabolomics uncovered subtle physiological responses of A. minutum to copepodamides, including dysregulation of valine biosynthesis and enhancement of butanoate metabolism and arginine biosynthesis. While we have yet to identify a chemoreceptor directly activated by copepod cues, based on the results of inhibition experiments detection of copepodamides appears to disrupt the activity of serine/threonine phosphatases leading to increased jasmonic acid biosynthesis and signaling, which leads to amplified gonyautoxin biosynthesis in A. minutum. This study is an important step toward a better understanding of chemosensory ecology of predator-prey interactions in phytoplankton.

Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) which strongly inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels in diverse animal taxa are produced by several species of the bloom-forming algal genus Alexandrium where they appear to function as chemical defenses against grazing copepods. Despite PSTs being produced and localized within phytoplankton cells, some copepods distinguish toxic from non-toxic prey, selectively ingesting less toxic cells, in ways that suggest cell surface recognition perhaps associated with non-polar metabolites. In this study LC/MS and NMR-based metabolomics revealed that the non-polar metabolomes of two toxic species (Alexandrium catenella and Alexandrium pacificum) vary considerably from their non-toxic congener Alexandrium tamarense despite all three being very closely related. Toxic and non-toxic Alexandrium spp. were distinguished from each other by metabolites belonging to seven lipid classes. Of these, 17 specific metabolites were significantly more abundant in both toxic A. catenella and A. pacificum compared to non-toxic A. tamarense suggesting that just a small portion of the observed metabolic variability is associated with toxicity. Future experiments aimed at deciphering chemoreception mechanisms of copepod perception of Alexandrium toxicity should consider these metabolites, and the broader lipid classes phosphatidylcholines and sterols, as potential candidate cues.

Genetically engineered mouse models are used to assess how genotypic variation in the general population may affect post-irradiation classification performance. Here, we used a mouse model that lacks the T-cell receptor specific alternative p38 pathway (p38aßY323F, double knock-in [DKI] mice) to determine how attenuated autoimmune and inflammatory responses may affect dose reconstruction. Objectives To determine if deficient alternative p38 activation differentially affects biofluid metabolic signatures post-irradiation compared to wild-type (WT). Methods Untargeted global metabolomics was used to assess biofluid signatures between WT and DKI mice (8 – 10 weeks old) after exposure to total body radiation (0, 2, or 7 Gy). Urine was analyzed in the first week (1, 3, and 7 d) and serum at 1 d. Spectral features of interest were identified using the machine learning algorithm Random Forests and MetaboLyzer. Validated metabolite panels were constructed and classification performance was assessed by determining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results A multidimensional scaling plot showed excellent separation of IR exposed groups in WT with slightly dampened responses in DKI mice. For both urine and serum, excellent sensitivity and specificity (AUROC > 0.90) was observed for 0 Gy vs. 7 Gy groups irrespective of genotype using identical metabolite panels. Similarly, excellent to fair classification (AUROC > 0.75) was observed for = 2 Gy vs. 7 Gy post-irradiation mice for both genotypes, however, model performance declined (AUROC < 0.75) between genotypes post-irradiation. Conclusion Overall, these results suggest less influence of the alternative p38 activation pathway for dose reconstruction compared to other radiosensitive genotypes.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001195	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M87M55			Systemic host inflammation induces stage-specific transcriptomic modification and slower maturation in malaria parasites	Previous reports suggest that the maturation rate of malaria parasites within red blood cells (RBC) is not constant for a given species in vivo. For instance, maturation can be influenced by host nutrient status or circadian rhythm. Here we observed in mice that systemic host inflammation, induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) conditioning or ongoing acute malaria infection, slowed the progression of a single cohort of parasites from one generation of RBC to the next. LPS-conditioning and acute infection both triggered substantial changes to the metabolomic composition of plasma in which parasites circulated. This altered plasma directly slowed parasite maturation in a manner that could not be rescued by supplementation, consistent with the presence of inhibitory factors. Single-cell transcriptomic assessment of mixed parasite populations, exposed to a short period of systemic host inflammation in vivo, revealed specific impairment in the transcriptional activity and translational capacity of trophozoites compared to rings or schizonts. Thus, we provide in vivo evidence of transcriptomic and phenotypic plasticity of asexual blood-stage Plasmodium parasites when exposed to systemic host inflammation

However, increasing evidence suggests that elevated amino acids cause cellular toxicity associated with numerous metabolic disorders. How cells cope with elevated amino acids remains poorly understood. Here, we show that a previously identified cellular structure, the mitochondrial-derived compartment (MDC), functions to protect cells from amino acid stress. In response to amino acid elevation, MDCs are generated from mitochondria, where they selectively sequester and deplete SLC25A nutrient carriers and their associated import receptor Tom70 from the organelle. Generation of MDCs promotes amino acid catabolism, and their formation occurs simultaneously with transporter removal at the plasma membrane via the multi-vesicular body (MVB) pathway. Combined loss of vacuolar amino acid storage, MVBs and MDCs renders cells sensitive to high amino acid stress. Thus, we propose that MDCs operate as part of a coordinated cell network that facilitates amino acid homoeostasis through post-translational nutrient transporter remodeling.

A subset of PDAC with inactivating mutations in ring finger protein 43 (RNF43) have growth dependency on autocrine WNT ligand signaling, which renders them susceptible to porcupine inhibitors (PORCNi) that block WNT ligand acylation and secretion. For this study, non-targeted metabolomic analyses were performed to explore the therapeutic response of RNF43-mutant PDAC to the PORCNi LGK974. AsPC-1 (RNF43-mutant) PDAC cells were treated with 25 nM LGK974 to explore stable isotope-resolved metabolomics with uniform 1, D-glucose [U13-C6] labeling.

However, conflicting data exist regarding the efficacy of KDs in melanoma, the deadliest skin cancer. Here, we show that two different KD formulations effectively reduced tumor growth in immunocompromised mice bearing genetically and metabolically heterogeneous human melanoma xenografts. Furthermore, the KDs exerted a metastasis-reducing effect in an immunocompetent syngeneic melanoma mouse model. Ketone bodies did not directly influence melanoma cell proliferation; therefore, we performed an in-depth metabolomics analysis using the MxP® Quant 500 kit combined with a acylcarnitine assay (biocrates life sciences ag)to elucidate potential antitumor mechanisms in vivo. Targeted analysis of plasma and tumor metabolomes revealed distinct changes in amino acid metabolism induced by the KDs. Moreover, the KDs increased sphingomyelin synthesis and hydroxylation of certain lipids. Thus, KDs simultaneously affect multiple metabolic pathways to create an unfavorable environment for melanoma cell proliferation, supporting their potential as a complementary nutritional approach to melanoma therapy.

Interventions to improve mitochondrial function have the potential to improve quality of life. Exercise training is a readily accessible and inexpensive intervention, however how it promotes mitochondrial adaptation in skeletal muscle remains poorly understood. Here, we describe an intricate and previously undemonstrated network of differentially prioritised training-induced adaptations in human skeletal muscle mitochondria. We show that changes in hundreds of transcripts, proteins and lipid species are not stoichiometrically linked to the increase in mitochondrial content. We demonstrate a prioritization of specific pathways at different stages of the intervention, including initial deprioritisation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and prioritisation of TCA cycle and fatty acid ß-oxidation linked mitochondrial respiration. This indicates that enhancing electron flow to OXPHOS is more important to increase ATP production than increasing the abundance of the OXPHOS machinery. Our research unearths the elaborate and multi-layered nature of the adaptive response to exercise and provides a valuable resource that can be mined to maximise the therapeutic benefits of exercise.

Therefore, we introduce a simultaneous dual extraction method for generating both metabolomic and glycomic profiles from one sample with good extraction efficiency and reproducibility. As proof of the usefulness of the extraction and joint-omics workflow, we applied it on platelet samples obtained from a cohort study comprising 66 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients and 34 matched healthy community-dwelling controls. The metabolomics and glycomics datasets were subjected to block partial least square – discriminant analysis (block-PLS-DA) with canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for identifying relevant mechanistic interactions between metabolites and glycans. This joint-omics investigation revealed inter-modulative roles that carbohydrates and amino acids have in metabolic pathways and through intermediate protein dysregulations. It also suggested a protective role of the glyco-redox network in CHD, demonstrating proof-of-principle for a joint-omics analysis in providing new insights into disease mechanisms, as enabled by a simultaneous metabolite-glycan extraction workflow.

The objective of this study was to determine if perturbations in gut microbial composition and the gut metabolome could be linked to individuals with obesity and osteoarthritis (OA). Methods. Fecal samples were collected from obese individuals diagnosed with radiographic hand plus knee OA (n=59), defined as involvement of at least 3 joints across both hands, and a Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade 2-4 (or total knee replacement) in at least one knee. Controls (n=33) were without hand OA and with KL grade 0-1 knees. Fecal metabolomes were analyzed by a UHPLC/Q Exactive HFx mass spectrometer. Microbiome composition was determined in fecal samples by 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing (rRNA-seq). Stepwise logistic regression models were built to determine microbiome and/or metabolic characteristics of OA. Results. Untargeted metabolomics analysis indicated that OA cases had significantly higher levels of di- and tri-peptides and significant perturbations in microbial metabolites including propionic acid, indoles and other tryptophan metabolites. Pathway analysis revealed several significantly perturbed pathways associated with OA including leukotriene metabolism, amino acid metabolism and fatty acid utilization. Logistic regression models selected metabolites associated with the gut microbiota and leaky gut syndrome as significant predictors of OA status, particularly when combined with the rRNA-seq data. Conclusions. Adults with obesity and OA have distinct fecal metabolomes characterized by increased products of proteolysis, perturbations in leukotriene metabolism, and changes in microbial metabolites compared with controls. These metabolic perturbations indicate a possible role of dysregulated proteolysis in OA.

Here, we show that mice with cardiomyocyte-specific knockout (KO) of Rev-erba/ß display progressive cardiac dilation and lethal heart failure. Inducible ablation of Rev-erba/ß in adult hearts causes similar phenotypes. Impaired fatty acid oxidation in the KO myocardium, particularly in the light cycle, precedes contractile dysfunctions with a reciprocal overreliance on carbohydrate utilization, particularly in the dark cycle. These findings delineate temporal coordination between clock-mediated anticipation and nutrient-induced response in myocardial metabolism.

To provide insight into the processes underlying benzene hematotoxicity, we performed high-resolution metabolomic (HRM) profiling of plasma collected from a cross-sectional study of 33 healthy workers exposed to benzene (median 8-hr time-weighted average exposure; 20 ppma), and 25 unexposed controls in Shanghai, China. Metabolic features associated with benzene were identified using a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) that tested for the relationship between feature intensity and benzene exposure. MWAS identified 478 mass spectral features associated with benzene exposure at FDR<20%. Comparison to a list of 13 known benzene metabolites and metabolites predicted using a multi-component biotransformation algorithm showed five metabolites were detected, which included the known metabolites phenol and benzene diolepoxide. Metabolic pathway enrichment identified 41 pathways associated with benzene exposure, with altered pathways including carnitine shuttle, fatty acid metabolism, sulfur amino acid metabolism, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and branched chain amino acid metabolism. These results suggest disruption to fatty acid uptake, energy metabolism and increased oxidative stress, and point towards pathways related to mitochondrial dysfunction, which has previously been linked to benzene exposure in animal models and human studies. Taken together, these results suggest benzene exposure is associated with disruption of mitochondrial pathways, and provide promising, systems biology biomarkers for risk assessment of benzene-induced hematotoxicity in humans.

However, the underlying mechanisms linking EC exposure with NAFLD remain poorly understood and there is no data on their impact on the human liver metabolome. Herein, we hypothesized that exposure to ECs, particularly perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), impacts liver metabolism, specifically bile acid metabolism. Methods: In a well-characterized human NAFLD cohort of 105 individuals, we investigated the effects of EC exposure on liver metabolism. We characterized the liver (via biopsy) and circulating metabolomes using four mass spectrometry-based analytical platforms, and measured PFAS and other ECs in serum. We subsequently compared these results with an exposure study in a PPARa-humanized mouse model. Results: PFAS exposure appears associated with perturbation of key hepatic metabolic pathways previously found altered in NAFLD, particularly as regards bile acid metabolism. Specifically, we identified stronger associations between the liver metabolome, chemical exposure and NAFLD-associated clinical variables in female subjects versus males. The murine exposure study further corroborated our findings, vis-à-vis a sex-specific association between PFAS exposure and NAFLD-associated lipid changes. Conclusions: Females may be more sensitive to the harmful impacts of PFAS. Lipid-related changes subsequent to PFAS exposure may be secondary to the interplay between PFAS and bile acid metabolism.

It is urgent to develop disease models to dissect mechanisms regulating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we derive airway organoids from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-AOs). The hPSC-AOs, particularly ciliated-like cells, are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using this platform, we perform a high content screen and identify GW6471, which blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection. GW6471 can also block infection of the B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variant. RNA-seq analysis suggests that GW6471 blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection at least in part by inhibiting HIF1a, which is further validated by chemical inhibitor and genetic perturbation targeting HIF1a. Metabolic profiling identifies decreased rates of glycolysis upon GW6471 treatment, consistent with transcriptome profiling. Finally, xanthohumol, 5-(Tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid, and ND-646, three compounds that suppress fatty acid biosynthesis, also block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, a high content screen coupled with transcriptome and metabolic profiling reveals a key role of the HIF1a-glycolysis axis in mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection of human airway epithelium.

Previous research has highlighted that a sublytic dose of MAC can initiate NLRP3 inflammasome activation via calcium influx and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Here, we show that sublytic concentrations of MAC mediate a previously undescribed perturbation in cellular energy metabolism in human monocyte-derived macrophages, by phenotypic skewing towards glycolysis and upregulation of glycolysis-promoting genes. Sublytic MAC concentrations drive mitochondrial dysfunction, characterised by a fragmented mitochondrial morphology, loss of maximal respiratory response, depleted mitochondrial membrane potential as well as increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. The consequences of these alterations in glycolytic metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction lead to NLRP3 inflammasome activation, driving gasdermin D formation and IL-18 release. This novel link between sublytic MAC and immunometabolism, with direct consequences for downstream inflammatory processes, is important for development of novel therapeutics for areas where MAC may mediate disease.

Entomopathogenic fungi have been successfully used to control agricultural pests. They infect insects by coming into direct contact with their cuticle or when feeding on contaminated leaves or fruits. After contact with the insect, the entomopathogenic fungus penetrates its body cavity, where it grows and colonizes it from within, causing its death The use of two or more microorganisms in a microbial consortium has been increasingly applied in the biological control of diseases and pests. Beauveria bassiana is one of the most widely studied fungal species in biological control, yet little is known about its role in fungal consortiums. In a previous study, our group found that a consortium formed by two strains of B. bassiana had significantly greater biocontrol potential against the polyphagous caterpillars Duponchelia fovealis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) than either strain on its own. Despite recent developments and growing efforts to better understand fungal metabolism and metabolites, much remains unknown. Metabolomics therefore represents an important field for evaluating the metabolites produced or modified by an organism or its relationship with the environment. In the present study, we aim to use untargeted metabolomics with gas and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometers (GC-MS and LC-MS/MS) to evaluate the metabolic alterations caused by the co-cultivation of these strains and to correlate the metabolites produced by this consortium with the increased mortality in D. fovealis observed previously.

Individuals who do not have gut microbial environments that produce ODMA have less favorable cardiometabolic and cancer risk profiles. Urinary metabolomics profiles were evaluated in relation to ODMA metabotypes within and between individuals over time. Secondary analysis was conducted of data from the BEAN2 trial, which was a cross-over study of premenopausal women consuming six months on a high- and a low-soy diet, each separated by a 1-month washout period. In all of the 672 samples in the study, 66 of the 84 women had the same ODMA metabotype at seven or all eight time points. Two or four urine samples per woman were selected based on temporal metabotypes in order to compare within and across individuals. Metabolomics assays for primary metabolism and biogenic amines were conducted in 60 urine samples from 20 women. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis was used to compare metabolomics profiles.

To investigate biological response mechanisms underlying exposure to traffic related pollutants, we used an integrated molecular response approach that included high-resolution metabolomic profiling and peripheral blood gene expression to identify biological responses to diesel exhaust exposure. Plasma samples were collected from 73 non-smoking males employed in the US trucking industry between February 2009 and October 2010 and analyzed using untargeted high-resolution metabolomics to characterize association with shift- and week-averaged levels of elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC) and particulate matter with diameter = 2.5 µm (PM2.5). Annotated metabolites associated with exposure were then tested for relationships with the peripheral blood transcriptome using multivariate selection and network correlation. Week-averaged EC and OC levels, which were averaged across multiple shifts during the workweek, resulted in the greatest exposure-associated metabolic alterations compared to shift-averaged exposure levels. Metabolic changes associated with EC exposure suggest increased lipid peroxidation products, biomarkers of oxidative stress, thrombotic signaling lipids, and metabolites associated with endothelial dysfunction from altered nitric oxide metabolism, while OC exposures were associated with antioxidants, oxidative stress biomarkers and critical intermediates in nitric oxide production. Correlation with whole blood RNA gene expression provided additional evidence of changes in processes related to endothelial function, immune response, inflammation, and oxidative stress. We did not detect metabolic associations with PM2.5. This study provides an integrated molecular assessment of human exposure to traffic-related air pollutants that includes diesel exhaust. Metabolite and gene expression changes associated with exposure to EC and OC are consistent with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and the adverse health effects of traffic-related air pollution.

Several classes of specialized metabolites have been reported to occur in the genus Equisetum. However, while steady progress is being made with identifying individual novel metabolites of Equisetum, few if any analyses have focused on assessing the chemical diversity across the genus. The present study focused on three species: E. hyemale subsp. affine (rough horsetail or scouring rush), which is native to the temperate to artic portions of North America; E. arvense (common horsetail), which is endemic to the arctic and temperate regions of the northern hemisphere; and Equisetum telmateia subsp. braunii (Milde) Hauke (giant horsetail), which is native to western North America. Both below-ground rhizome and above-ground shoot material was harvested from each species, extracted with aqueous methanol, and subjected to non-targeted HPLC-QTOF-MS analysis. This research project was designed to lay the foundation for continued research to capture the metabolic capabilities in the ferns and fern allies.

To develop safe and potent therapeutics, insights into the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are urgently needed. We reported the multi-omics profiling of the liver and sera of both peripheral blood and hepatic portal vein blood from Macaca fascicularis with spontaneous diabetes mellitus with a chow diet. The other two groups of the monkeys fed with chow diet and high-sugar high-fat (HSHF) diet, respectively, were included for comparison. These multi-omics datasets can provide a comprehensive picture of the molecular changes caused by diabetes in primates. Analyses of various omics datasets revealed the alterations of high consistency. Correlation between transcripts and proteins derived from the same genes was observed across individuals for most genes, especially the ones of differential expression. As a result, we found that distinct patterns of the metabolome, proteome, and transcriptome between spontaneous diabetes and HSHF diet-induced diabetes compared with healthy individuals.

Herein, combining multi-meta-omics approaches, carbohydrate enzymology and X-ray crystallography, we elucidated the microbial community composition and structure, enzymatic systems and metabolic pathways involved in the conversion of recalcitrant dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids, a main energy source for the host. The high efficiency of this microbiota in the deconstruction of plant polysaccharides is underpinned on the combination of unique enzymatic mechanisms from Fibrobacteres to degrade cellulose with a broad arsenal of Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZymes) organized in polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) from Bacteroidetes, to tackle with complex hemicelluloses typically found in gramineous and aquatic plants. Exploring the genomic dark matter of this community, two novel CAZy families were unveiled including a glycoside hydrolase family of ß-galactosidases and a carbohydrate-binding module family involved in xylan binding that establishes an unprecedented three-dimensional fold among associated modules to CAZymes. Together, these results demonstrate at community and molecular levels how the capybara gut microbiota orchestrates the deconstruction and utilization of dietary fibers, representing an untapped reservoir of new and intricate enzymatic mechanisms to overcome the lignocellulose recalcitrance, a central challenge toward a bio-based and sustainable economy.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) poses a major health challenge, with tens of millions of new cases reported globally every year. Brain damage resulting from TBI can vary significantly due to factors including injury severity, diffusivity, modality, time delay relative to impact, and exposure to repeated injury events. Untargeted lipidomic analysis of Sprague-Dawley rat serum within 24 hours of mild single and repeat controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury events led to the discovery of biomarker candidates of TBI. Lipid biomarkers have a unique potential to serve as objective molecular measures of the body’s response to injury as their alteration in brain tissue can be more freely observed than for larger protein markers. Animal serum was analyzed via ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) in positive and negative ion modes. Known lipid species were identified through matching to in-house tandem MS databases. Machine learning and feature selection approaches were used to construct lipid panels capable of distinguishing serum from injured and uninjured animals across a range of injury severities and timepoints within the first day of injury. The best multivariate lipid panels had over 90% cross-validated sensitivity, selectivity, and accuracy and consisted of species from nine different lipid classes. These mapped onto sphingolipid signaling, autophagy, necroptosis and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways, with FDR corrected p-values better than 0.05.

An underappreciated source of damage to Fe-S clusters are cuprous (Cu1+) ions. Since histone H3 enzymatically produces Cu1+ to support copper-dependent functions, we asked whether this activity could become detrimental to Fe-S clusters. Here, we report that histone H3-mediated Cu1+ toxicity is a major determinant of cellular functional pool of Fe-S clusters. Inadequate Fe-S cluster supply, either due to diminished assembly as occurs in Friedreich’s Ataxia or defective distribution, causes severe metabolic and growth defects in S. cerevisiae. Decreasing Cu1+ abundance, through attenuation of histone cupric reductase activity or depletion of total cellular copper, restored Fe-S cluster-dependent metabolism and growth. Our findings reveal a novel interplay between chromatin and mitochondria in Fe-S cluster homeostasis, and a potential pathogenic role for histone enzyme activity and Cu1+ in diseases with Fe-S cluster dysfunction.

To study dynamic changes in the metabolome, footprint analysis (exometabolome extracted from the spent media of glucose grown Rubrivivax benzoatilyticus cells), using GC-MS, was carried out at three time points- exponential phase (G3), early (G9) and late (G18) stationary phase. Metabolites were extracted in methanol, derivatized by adding BSTFA-TCMS to protect the functional groups and analysed by GC-MS. The analysis listed metabolic features at each time point, of which 149 metabolites were identified, based on the mass spectra comparison in the database (NIST similarity >700, Golm database), at one and/or other time point, while other metabolites remained unidentified. Identified metabolic features along with their respective peak area at G3, G9 and G18 were recorded and submitted to MetaboAnalyst 4.0 online software to identify significant metabolic pattern and variation. The result of the Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA) shows that metabolites clustered into five groups based on the response pattern specifying the metabolic dissimilarity between the three samples. Group I, II and V comprises metabolites with high concentration in G18, G9 and G3 samples respectively, group III and IV includes metabolites whose concentration was high in two of the three samples. Pairwise score plot of principal component analysis (PCA) provided an overview of the separation pattern amongst the most significant principal components (PCs). To assess the significance of class discrimination, partial least squares - discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was performed. The exometabolome samples were seen clearly separated by PLS-DA analysis with the R2 and Q2 value of 0.95 and 0.4 respectively indicating the goodness of fit and predictability, suggesting representative model for the difference in metabolomes. The Variable Importance in Projection (VIP scores) derived from PLS-DA model was used to ascertain key metabolic features significant for group separation. Metabolites with VIP score >1 were considered to have statistically contributed to the model. Forty metabolites were identified as statistically significant contributors to the model and were mainly accountable for group separation in the model. Metabolites were classified based on their chemical structure as alkanes (20%), sugars (28%), organic acid (17%), amino acid (10%), fatty acid (8%), nucleotide (3%) and others (5%). Amongst these forty metabolites, a total of 19, 25 and 33 were detected in G3, G9 and G18 samples respectively.

The occurrence of juvenile cases demonstrates that PD is not necessarily an age-associated disease, indeed evidence is accumulating that there is a developmental component to PD pathogenesis. We hypothesize that additional genetic modifiers, potentially including genetic loci relevant to mesencephalic dopamine neuron development may play a role. We differentiated human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from SM and PM into mitotically active mesencephalic neural precursor cells and early post mitotic dopaminergic neurons and performed whole exome sequencing, transcriptomic- and metabolomic analyses. No significant differences in canonical markers of differentiation were observed between SM and PM. Yet our transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant down regulation of three neurodevelopmentally relevant cell adhesion molecules, CNTN6, CNTN4 and CHL1 in PM - compared to SM cultures on days 11 and 25 of differentiation. In addition, several HLA genes, known to play a role in neurodevelopment, independent of their well-established function in immunity, were differentially regulated in PM and SM developing dopamine neurons. EN2, a transcription factor crucial for mesencephalic dopamine neuron development, was also differentially regulated. We further observed differences in cellular processes relevant to dopamine homeostasis. Lastly, our whole exome sequencing, transcriptomics and metabolomics data of SM and PM neurons revealed differences in GSH homeostasis, the dysregulation of which has been associated with PD.

To analyze the changes of metabolites, we conducted the CE-TOF/MS analysis using BAT from TAC (thoracic aortic constriction) or sham-operated mice. In BAT from TAC-operated mice, we found increase of choline and glycerophosphorylcholine and a decrease of phosphorylcholine, suggesting that BAT dysfunction induces the disorientation of choline metabolism.

In this study, we identified thioesterase superfamily member 6 (THEM6) as a marker of ADT resistance in PCa. In patients, THEM6 expression correlates with progressive disease and is associated with poor survival. THEM6 deletion reduces in vivo tumour growth and restores castration sensitivity in orthograft models of CRPC. Mechanistically, THEM6 is located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and controls lipid homeostasis by regulating intracellular levels of ether lipids. As a consequence, THEM6 loss in CRPC cells significantly alters ER function, preventing lipid-mediated induction of ATF4 and reducing de novo sterol biosynthesis. Finally, we show that THEM6 is required for the establishment of the MYC-induced stress response. Thus, similar to PCa, THEM6 loss significantly impairs tumorigenesis in the MYC-dependent subtype of triple negative breast cancer. Altogether our results highlight THEM6 as a novel component of the treatment-induced stress response and a promising target for the treatment of CRPC and MYC-driven cancer.

In this regard, the CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) developed by microalgae implies an efficient machinery to acquire CO2 in limiting environment. Inorganic carbon transporters channelize CO2 towards Rubisco, however, there are significant differences in the CCM of some species and it is obscurely understood. In the present study, we performed qualitative metabolomics and proteomics on Microchloropsis gaditana, under the influence of very-low CO2 (VLC; 300 ppm, or 0.03%) and high CO2 (HC; 30,000 ppm, or 3% v/v) at the time intervals of 0, 6, 12 and 24 hrs. Our results demonstrate that HC supplementation channelizes the carbon flux towards enhancing the biomass yield, increasing up to 1.7-fold. Cyclic electron flow driven (CEF) by PSI confers energy to the cells in the case of VLC in the initial acclimatization stage. Our qualitative metabolomic analyses has identified nearly 35 essential metabolites among which significant fold-change was observed as a photorespiratory by-product, glycolate, in VLC resulting in delayed growth and lower biomass. Whole cell proteomics study was performed in M. gaditana in both VLC and HC conditions and a total of 998 proteins were identified. Cells in VLC, undergoes dynamic changes to activate biophysical CCM with the help of bicarbonate transporters. In conclusion, comprehensive changes occur inside the cell that consequently mediate the assimilation and regulation of carbon metabolic loadout such that it favours fatty acid biosynthesis in HC. In conclusion, our emphasis is to delineate carbon assimilation in M. gaditana with the help of advanced multi-omics tools and provide translational approach for the enhanced production of biofuels and biorenewables.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001252	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8W423			NMR Hydrophilic Metabolomic Analysis of Bacterial Resistance Pathways using Multivalent Antimicrobials with Challenged and Unchallenged Wild Type and Mutated Gram Positive Bacteria	Multivalent membrane disruptors are a relatively new antimicrobial scaffold that are difficult for bacteria to develop resistance to and can act on both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) metabolomics is an important method for studying resistance development in bacteria since it is both a quantitative and qualitative method to study and identify phenotypes by changes in metabolic pathways. The objectives are to determine the likely metabolic differences between antimicrobially challenged and unchallenged growth and wild type and antimicrobially mutated Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) samples by using NMR hydrophilic metabolomics. Proton (1H) NMR hydrophilic metabolite analysis was conducted using B. cereus wild type and B. cereus that was mutated with C16-DABCO and mannose functionalized poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (DABCOMD). Both the wild type and the mutated sample types were grown in low levels of DABCOMD (challenged samples) or without the addition of DABCOMD to the growth media (unchallenged samples) for sample collection at the mid log and stationary phases and for growth curve procurement. Hierarchical clustering of only the challenged sample type showed that both the stationary phase sample types (mutant and wild type) clustered together while the both the mid log phase sample types were distinct. Hierarchical clustering of the unchallenged samples showed complete separation of all sample types. There were statistically significant (p-value and fold change) changes in the concentrations of metabolites in both energy related pathways and peptidoglycan synthesis between all sample types, especially with mutants and especially the challenged sample types have more N-acetylglucosamine (as much as a 94.2-fold increase). The mid log phase sample types showed a larger difference between sample types than their stationary phase counter parts. The challenged and unchallenged mutant samples showed a larger difference between sample types in comparison to the differences between the challenged and unchallenged wild type sample types. There was a larger metabolite difference when comparing the challenged mutant samples to the challenged wild type samples than when comparing the unchallenged mutant samples to the unchallenged wild type samples. The metabolomic analysis of wild type and multivalent DABCOMD mutated B. cereus under both challenged and unchallenged conditions indicated that the mutants, especially the challenged mutants, are likely changing their peptidoglycan layer to protect themselves from the high positive charge on the membrane disrupting DABCOMD. This membrane fortification most likely led to the slow growth curve of the mutated and especially the challenged mutant samples. The association of these sample types with metabolites associated with energy expenditure is attributed to the increased energy required for these changes to occur as well as to the decreased diffusion of nutrients across the membrane.

Animal health is one of the most important factors that can also alter animal integrity and welfare. Some studies have already investigated the link between health and metabolic profile of dairy animals. These studies in metabolomics often consider a single type of sample using a single analytical platform (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance or Mass Spectrometry). Only few studies with multi-platform approaches are also used with a single or a multi type of sample, but they mainly consider dairy cows metabolome although dairy goats present similar diseases, that it could be interesting to detect early to preserve animal health and milk production. This study aims to create a metabolic atlas of goat plasma, milk, and feces, based on healthy animals. Our study describes a Standard Operating Procedure for three goat matrices: blood plasma, milk, and feces using multiple platforms (NMR (1H), UHPLC (RP)-MS and UHPLC (HILIC)-MS) that follows a unique sample preparation procedure for each sample type to be analyzed on multi-platforms basis. Our method was evaluated for its robustness and allowed a better characterization of goat metabolic profile in healthy conditions.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001257	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M87986			Non-destructive characterization of Mesenchymal stem cells	Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown promising results in clinical trials for their anti-inflammatory function. However, MSC therapy isn’t licensed by FDA, in part because of the heterogeneity of MSCs. The lack of predictive markers also makes it difficult to both manufacture and translate MSCs into clinic. Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase (IDO) assay and T cell suppression assays correlate with MSCs function. We previously showed that cellular metabolites can be used to predict IDO assay and T cell suppression results. Although these methods are promising, they are all destructive and time-consuming and therefore cannot easily translate to a cell manufacturing setting. A non-destructive, in-process method to evaluate cell quality would be extremely valuable. Methods: Culture media from the growth of three different MSC cell lines (two bone marrow, one iPSC) were sampled daily for NMR metabolomics analysis. T cell proliferation and IDO assays were used as surrogates of anti-inflammatory function. Linear regression was used to assess the media metabolic changes over time, and partial least squares regression (PLSR) was then used to obtain predictive media markers (PMMs) based on variable importance in projection (VIP) scores. In addition, pathway analysis was performed to show the relations between media metabolites (MMs) and cell metabolites (CMs). Results: Depending on the time of sampling, PLSR of culture media regressed against a composite score resulted in R2 values between 0.73 and 0.86. Several amnio acids and organic acids were useful PMMs at different time periods. Correlation and pathway analyses related the consumption of valine and aspartate to the release of glycine and alanine during culture. Discussion: The work described here used PLSR models to identify PMMs that can predict MSC function. This method is relatively simple, non-destructive and can could in the future be used in a manufacturing setting to help predict MSC function.

Candida albicans is an opportunistic yeast pathogen that causes a wide range of infections especially amongst immunocompromised patients. Aureobasidin A (AbA) has been shown to inhibit inositolphosphoryl ceramide synthase (IPCS), a key enzyme responsible for sphingolipid biosynthesis. There are limited studies exploring IPCS as a target molecule for antifungal treatment. It is hypothesized that the mechanism of AbA inhibition involves alteration of C. albicans phospholipid and sphingolipid profiles. The profiling of C. albicans phospholipid and sphingolipid upon exposure to 0.5-4 µg/ml of AbA were determined using Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001259	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8ZX2N			Metabolomic Fingerprinting of Human High Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma Cell Lines	Focusing on defining the metabolomic basis of intratumoral heterogeneity in ovarian cancer, the metabolic diversity of a panel of high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) cell-lines we investigated using a metabolomics platform that interrogate 731 compounds. Metabolic fingerprinting followed by 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional principal component analysis defined the heterogeneity of the HGSOC cells and clustered them into five distinct metabolic groups. An overall increase in the metabolites associated with aerobic glycolysis and phospholipid metabolism were observed in the majority of the cancer cells. A preponderant increase in the levels of metabolites involved in trans-sulfuration and glutathione synthesis was also observed. Subsets of HGSOC cells showed an increase in the levels of 5-Hydroxytryptamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, or glutamate, pointing to their potential role as oncometabolites. In summary, our results identify increased glycolysis, phospholipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism with the resultant increase in the levels of 5-Hydoxytryptamine, GABA, and Glutamate as metabolomic correlates underlying the heterogeneity of ovarian cancer cell lines.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001260	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8V401			Metabolic adaptations in an endocrine-related breast cancer mouse model unveil potential markers of tumor response to hormonal therapy	Breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of cancer in women and, in most cases, it is hormone-dependent (HD), thus relying on ovarian hormone activation of intracellular receptors to stimulate tumor growth. Endocrine therapy (ET) aimed at preventing hormone receptor activation is the primary treatment strategy, however, about half of the patients, develop resistance in time. This involves the development of hormone independent tumors that initially are ET-responsive (HI), which may subsequently become resistant (HIR). The mechanisms that promote the conversion of HI to HIR tumors are varied and not completely understood. The aim of this work was to characterize the metabolic adaptations accompanying this conversion through the analysis of the polar metabolomes of tumor tissue and non-compromised mammary gland from mice implanted subcutaneously with HD, HI and HIR tumors from a medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)-induced BC mouse model. This was carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of tissue polar extracts and data mining through multivariate and univariate statistical analysis. Initial results unveiled marked changes between global tumor profiles and non-compromised mammary gland tissues, as expected. More importantly, specific metabolic signatures were found to accompany progression from HD, through HI and to HIR tumors, impacting on amino acids, nucleotides, membrane percursors and metabolites related to oxidative stress protection mechanisms. For each transition, sets of polar metabolites are advanced as potential markers of progression, including acquisition of resistance to ET. Putative biochemical interpretation of such signatures are proposed and discussed.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001262	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8KM58			Fbxo7 promotes Cdk6 activity to inhibit PFKP and glycolysis in T cells	Deregulated Fbxo7 expression is associated with many pathologies, including anaemia, male sterility, cancer, and Parkinson’s disease, demonstrating its critical role in a variety of cell types. Although Fbxo7 is an F-box protein that recruits substrates for SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligases, it also promotes the formation of cyclin D/Cdk6/p27 complexes in an E3-ligase independent fashion. We discovered PFKP, the major gatekeeper of glycolysis, in a screen for Fbxo7 substrates. PFKP has been previously shown to be a critical substrate of Cdk6 for the viability of T-ALL cells experiencing high levels of reactive oxygen species. We investigated the molecular relationships between Fbxo7, Cdk6 and PFKP, and the functional effect Fbxo7 has on T cell metabolism, viability, and activation. Fbxo7 promotes Cdk6-independent ubiquitination and Cdk6-dependent phosphorylation of PFKP. Importantly Fbxo7-deficient cells have reduced Cdk6 activity, and haematopoietic and lymphocytic cell lines show a significant dependency on Fbxo7. CD4+ T cells with reduced Fbxo7 have increased glycolysis, and lower cell viability and activation levels. Metabolomic studies of activated CD4+ T cells confirm increased glycolytic flux in Fbxo7-deficient cells, as well as altered nucleotide biosynthesis and arginine metabolism. We show Fbxo7 expression is glucose-responsive, and we propose Fbxo7 inhibits PFKP and glycolysis via its activation of Cdk6.

Previously, we observed that CP at a low concentration of 0.01 mg/ml inhibits the growth of dominant infant bacteria such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii both during the exponential phase as well as in the stationary phase. Here, we investigate the underlying mechanism of the CP inhibition on infant-gut bacteria using F. prausnitzii as a model by analysing its growth at a transcriptomic and lipidomic level.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001264	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8B39F			Metabolomics of the interaction between a consortium of entomopathogenic fungi and their target insect: mechanisms of attack and survival	One of the most concerning pests that attack strawberries in Brazil is Duponchelia fovealis, a non-native moth with no registered control methods to date. Our group recently observed that a fungal consortium formed by two strains of Beauveria bassiana increased the mortality of D. fovealis more than inoculation with each strain on its own. However, the molecular interaction between the fungal consortium and the caterpillars is unknown, raising several questions about the enhanced pest control observed. Furthermore, concerns over the emergency of resistance and the selection for resistance to chemical and biological products that are constantly applied in agriculture highlight the need for careful examination of novel pest control methods. Thus, in this work, we sought to pioneer the evaluation of the molecular interaction between a fungal consortium of B. bassiana and D. fovealis caterpillars. We aimed to understand the biocontrol process involved in this interaction and the defense system of the caterpillar. Therefore, seven days after D. fovealis caterpillars were inoculated with the B. bassiana consortium, the dead and surviving caterpillars were analyzed using GC-MS and LC-MS/MS.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001267	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8XX3Q			Mutasynthetic production and antimicrobial characterisation of Darobactin darobactin analogs_NMR analysis	There is great need for therapeutics against multi-drug resistant, Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Recently, darobactin A, a novel bicyclic heptapeptide that selectively kills Gram-negative bacteria by targeting the outer-membrane protein BamA, was discovered. Its efficacy was proven in animal infection models of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, thus promoting darobactin A as a promising lead compound. Originally discovered from members of the nematode symbiotic genus Photorhabdus, the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encoding for the synthesis of darobactin A can also be found in other ?-proteobacterial families. Therein, the precursor peptides DarB-F, which differ in their core sequence from darobactin A, were identified in silico. Even though production of these analogs was not observed in the putative producer strains, we were able to generate them by mutasynthetic derivatization of a heterologous expression system. The generated analogs were isolated and tested for their bioactivity. The most potent compound, darobactin B, was used for co-crystallization with the target BamA, revealing an identical binding site to darobactin A. Besides its potency, darobactin B did not exhibit cytotoxicity and was slightly more active against Acinetobacter baumanii isolates than darobactin A. Furthermore, we evaluated the plasma protein binding of darobactin A and B, indicating their different pharmacokinetic properties. This is the first report on new members of this new antibiotics class, which is likely to expand to several promising therapeutic candidates
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001268	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8T39S			Polyamine import and accumulation causes immunomodulation in macrophages engulfing apoptotic cells	Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, termed efferocytosis, is critical for tissue homeostasis and drives anti-inflammatory programming in engulfing macrophages. Here, we assess metabolites in naïve and inflammatory macrophages following engulfment of multiple cellular and non-cellular targets. Efferocytosis leads to unique increases in the arginine-derived polyamines, spermidine and spermine, in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, polyamine accumulation after efferocytosis does not arise from retention of apoptotic cell metabolites or de novo synthesis, but from enhanced polyamine import that is dependent on Rac1, actin, and PI3 kinase. Blocking polyamine import prevents efferocytosis from suppressing macrophage IL-1??or IL-6. This identifies efferocytosis as a trigger for polyamine import and accumulation, and imported polyamines as mediators of efferocytosis-induced immune reprogramming.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001272	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M89402			Metabolic profiles of murine stress erythroid progenitors	Inflammation alters hematopoiesis, skewing production to generate myeloid effector cells at the expense of steady state erythropoiesis. To compensate, stress erythropoiesis is induced to maintain homeostasis until the inflammation is resolved. Unlike the constant production of steady state erythropoiesis, stress erythropoiesis generates a bolus of new erythrocytes by first producing immature progenitor cells, which then transition to committed erythroid progenitors and differentiate. We hypothesize that the proliferation of early progenitor cells and their transition to differentiation is regulated by changes in metabolism. Metabolomics and isotope tracing analysis was performed to assess the intracellular metabolic profiles in proliferating progenitors isolated from in vitro stress erythropoiesis cultures. We observed an active engagement of glucose metabolism in glycolysis and anabolic biosynthesis, while the levels of TCA intermediates suggested that TCA cycle and mitochondrial respiration were blocked. Concomitantly, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was induced in progenitor cells to increase the production of nitric oxide (NO), which was demonstrated to be crucial for proliferating progenitor metabolism. Inhibition or genetic mutation of iNOS decreased NO levels resulting in the suppression of progenitor proliferation in vitro and in vivo. As evaluated by RNA-seq, inhibition of iNOS suppressed cell proliferation-related pathways including cell cycle and nucleotide metabolism, while upregulating erythroid differentiation genes. These data suggest that iNOS-derived NO production establishes a metabolism that promotes the proliferation of progenitor cells while inhibiting their differentiation. In contrast, the transition to differentiation is marked by decreased Nos2 expression and a change in metabolism to support induction of the erythroid gene expression program. These data support a model where increased pro-inflammatory signals inhibit steady state erythropoiesis, while at the same time promoting stress erythropoiesis to maintain homeostasis.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001273	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85D8M			Glycine betaine uptake and metabolism in marine microbial communities	Glycine betaine (GBT) is a component of labile dissolved organic matter and a compatible solute in high concentrations in marine microbial populations. GBT has complex biochemical potential, but, once taken up from the environment, the cellular fate of the carbon and nitrogen from GBT is unknown. Here we determine the uptake kinetics and metabolism of GBT in two natural microbial communities characterized by different nitrate concentrations in the North Pacific transition zone. Dissolved GBT had maximum uptake rates of 0.36 and 0.56 nM hr -1 and half-saturation constants of 79 and 11 nM in the high nitrate and low nitrate stations, respectively. GBT taken into cells was predominantly retained as an untransformed compatible solute. A portion of GBT was transformed into other metabolites, through characterized and uncharacterized pathways. Where nitrate was scarce, GBT was primarily catabolized via the demethylation to glycine. Resulting metabolites were used to build protein biomass, and remineralized ammonia was re-assimilated into cells. Gene expression data from this region show that bacteria, especially SAR11, are the dominant organisms expressing the demethylation genes. Where nitrate concentrations were higher, more GBT was used for choline synthesis. Our data highlight undiscussed metabolic pathways and potential routes of microbial metabolite exchange.

The molecular features and associated biological functions of this phenotype remain poorly understood. We developed carboplatin resistant cell line models using OVCAR5 and CaOV3 cell lines with the aim of identifying chemoresistance-specific molecular features. Mass spectrometry analysis was used to analyse the metabolome of these cell lines and was able to separate these populations based on their molecular features. It revealed signaling and metabolic perturbations in chemoresistant cell lines. A comprehensive analysis of a larger patient cohort, including advanced in vitro and in vivo models, promises to help better understand the molecular mechanisms of chemo-resistance and associated enhancement of migration and invasion.

Microcin J25 (MccJ25), a bacteriocin produced by Escherichia coli, is a potent inhibitor of several pathogenic bacteria including Salmonella enterica. In this study, we aimed to evaluate in vitro the impact of MccJ25 on the metabolic activity of the swine colonic microbiota. The PolyFermS in vitro continuous fermentation model was used with modified Macfarlane medium to simulate the porcine proximal colon. During 35 days of fermentation, a first-stage reactor containing immobilized swine fecal microbiota fed two second-stage control and test reactors operated in parallel and used to test the effectsof MccJ25 on the composition and the metabolic activity of the microbiota. Reuterin, a broad spectrum antimicrobial produced by Limosilactobacillus reuteri and the antibiotic rifampicin were tested for comparison. LC-MS analysis of the cell extracts was used to assess the bacteriocin/antibiotic degradation products and monitor changes in the swine colonic microbiota metabolome.

We have compared the circulating metabolic fingerprints of glioma patients versus healthy controls, for the first time, in a quest to identify a panel of small, dysregulated metabolites with potential to serve as a predictive and/or diagnostic marker in the clinical settings. High-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HRMAS-NMR) was used for untargeted metabolomics and data acquisition followed by a machine learning (ML) approach for the analyses of large metabolic datasets. Cross-validation of ML predicted NMR spectral features was done by statistical methods (Wilcoxon-test) using JMP-pro16 software. Alanine was identified as the most critical metabolite with potential to detect glioma with precision of 1.0, recall of 0.96, and F1 measure of 0.98. The top 10 metabolites identified for glioma detection included alanine, glutamine, valine, methionine, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serine, a-glucose, lactate, and arginine. We achieved 100% accuracy for the detection of glioma using ML algorithms, extra tree classifier, and random forest, and 98% accuracy with logistic regression. Classification of glioma in low and high grades was done with 86% accuracy using logistic regression model, and with 83% and 79% accuracy using extra tree classifier and random forest, respectively. The predictive accuracy of our ML model is superior to any of the previously reported algorithms, used in tissue- or liquid biopsy-based metabolic studies. The identified top metabolites can be targeted to develop early diagnostic methods as well as to plan personalized treatment strategies.

This was to determine sentinel serum sample utility for a quality management program to monitor NMR reproducibility. Sentinel serum quality control samples allowed the quantification of variance between different profilers within a project. They also demonstrated declines in metabolite concentrations over time. A sentinel program is useful for tracking changes in QC serum samples from long-term storage. Separately, QC samples show negligible variance introduced by multiple profilers of NMR spectra within a project.

Thus, disorders can lead to diseases. In this study, we aimed to apply targeted metabolomics approach to investigate rodent thyroid toxicity. For this purpose, male Wistar rats have been exposed to a direct (6-propyl-2-thiouracil, PTU) and an indirect (phenytoin) thyroid toxicant, respectively. Thereby, two doses (low:5ppm for PTU and 300ppm for phenytoin , high: 50ppm for PTU and 2400ppm for phenytoin) and three exposure time phase (short: 2 weeks, long:4 weeks, and long+recovery: 4weeks+2weeks) were investigated, allowing insights into the modes of action during thyroid toxicity. Targeted metabolomics were applied to both liver and thyroid gland tissue.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001286	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8GQ5C			Plasmodium falciparum stable-isotope carbon labeling to explore metabolic consequences of keto–acid dehydrogenase disruption	Plasmodium falciparum is the most virulent species of parasites that cause malaria. Among other differences, these parasites have a limited reliance on mitochondrial metabolism during their asexual blood stages when compared to model eukaryotes or other parasite stages. Our study aimed to analyze lines of these parasites where one or more of the keto-acid dehydrogenase enzymes that are localized to the mitochondrion were disrupted to determine the importance of acetyl-CoA generation within this organelle. We utilized a targeted HPLC/MS-based approach to profile metabolite abundances and obtain the fractional incorporation of metabolites that are critical to central carbon metabolism (glucose, glutamine, or acetate) into acetyl-CoA and other landmark metabolites across a 2.5-hour time window. Glucose or glutamine were added at standard culture conditions. Acetate experiments used 5 mM acetate, which was shown to permit growth of synthetic lethal lines. The results of these studies demonstrated that synthetic lethal mutant parasites, which were observed when both mitochondrial keto-acid dehydrogenases (PF3D7_0303700.1 and PF3D7_1320800.1) were disrupted, resulted in the lack of incorporation of heavy glucose into acetyl-CoA. However, lines that lacked the synthetic lethal phenotype also resulted in essentially a complete lack of glucose incorporation into acetyl-CoA as long as the mPDH-like subunits (PF3D7_1312600.1 and PF3D7_0303700.1) were disrupted, which suggests that the a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase enzyme possesses a small amount of enzymatic activity to rescue this metabolic disruption. Furthermore, acetate supplementation experiments have demonstrated that exogenously supplied acetate circumvents these lethal effects and is not notably incorporated into the TCA cycle, which highlights the ability of the nuclear/cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthetase activity to circumvent mitochondrial metabolism given the presence of excess acetate. These studies are necessary for understanding pharmacology effects of relatively new acetyl-CoA-production disrupting drugs and possible resistance mechanisms that may evolve in the future.

In patients undergoing hemopoietic stem cell transplantation, iron overload is a common risk factor for poor outcomes. Previous studies assert that both irradiation and iron independently modulate tryptophan and indole metabolism of the microbiome, which may in turn impact host immune response. However, no studies have interrogated the multi-organ effects of these treatments concurrently. Herein, we use a model that recapitulate transfusional iron overload, a condition often observed in chronically transfused patients with thalassemia, sickle cell disease, or myelodysplastic syndrome. We applied an omics approach to investigate the impact of both iron load and irradiation on the host metabolome. Our results revealed dose-dependent effects of irradiation in red blood cells (RBC), plasma, spleen, and liver energy and redox metabolism. Increases in polyamines and purine salvage metabolites were observed in organs with high oxygen consumption including the heart, kidney, and brain. Irradiation also impacted the metabolism of the duodenum, colon, and stool, suggesting a potential effect on the microbiome. Iron infusion affected the respose to radiation in the organs and blood, especially in RBC polyamine metabolism and spleen antioxidant metabolism, and affected glucose, sulfur (especially methionine and glutathione systems) and tryptophan metabolism in the liver, stool, and brain. Together, the results suggest that radiation impacts metabolism on a multi-organ level with a significant interaction of host iron status.

Specifically we are interested testing the hypothesis that gestational hypoxia will result in discernable differences in glucose and lipid metabolism in tissues and plasma as well influence indicators of oxidative stress and inflammation. These studies aim to delineate pathways and biomarkers that help explain how hypoxia leads to the development of neonatal as well as adult-onset diseases associated with chronic hypoxia that are inter-related with fetal growth restriction. From a vascular perspective this includes cerebrovascular hemorrhage and pulmonary hypertension in the newborn, but more broadly it includes development of diseases later in life including diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease.

(bioRxiv 2021.05.06.442938). The below is taken from the abstract: Motivation: Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) provides rich biochemical information in a label-free manner and therefore holds promise to substantially impact current practice in disease diagnosis. However, the complex nature of MSI data poses computational challenges in its analysis. The complexity of the data arises from its large size, high dimensionality, and spectral non-linearity. Preprocessing, including peak picking, has been used to reduce raw data complexity, however peak picking is sensitive to parameter selection that, perhaps prematurely, shapes the downstream analysis for tissue classification and ensuing biological interpretation. Results: We propose a deep learning model, massNet, that provides the desired qualities of scalability, nonlinearity, and speed in MSI data analysis. This deep learning model was used, without prior preprocessing and peak picking, to classify MSI data from a mouse brain harboring a patient-derived tumor. The massNet architecture established automatically learning of predictive features, and automated methods were incorporated to identify peaks with potential for tumor delineation. The model’s performance was assessed using cross-validation, and the results demonstrate higher accuracy and a 174-fold gain in speed compared to the established classical machine learning method, support vector machine.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001293	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8KH6M			A Taguchi Design of Experiments Approach for Untargeted Metabolomics Sample Preparation Optimization	Metabolomics commonly uses analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to quantify and identify metabolites associated with biological variation. Metabolome coverage from non-targeted LC-MS studies relies heavily on the pre-analytical protocols (e.g., homogenization and extraction) used. Chosen protocols impact which metabolites are successfully measured, which in turn impacts biological conclusions. Different homogenization and extraction methods produce significant variability in metabolome coverage, sample reproducibility, and extraction efficiency. Herein we describe an efficient Taguchi method design of experiments (DOE) approach to optimize the extraction solvent and volume, extraction time, and LC reconstitution solvent for a sequential non-polar and polar Caenorhabditis elegans extraction. DOE is rarely used in metabolomics yet provides a systematic approach for optimizing sample preparation while simultaneously decreasing the number of experiments required to obtain high-quality data.

We uncovered interesting biology of LPC 18:1, in which LPC 18:1 induced optic nerve function restoration through oligodendrocyte maturation and remyelination in mouse model systems. Our in vitro studies show LPC 18:1 protection against neuron-ectopic hyper-deimination and stimulation of oligodendrocyte maturation, while in vivo investigations recorded optic nerve function improvement following optic nerve injections of LPC 18:1, in contrast to LPC 18:0. Thus just a change in a single bond renders a dramatic alternation in biological function. The incorporation of isobaric C13-histidine in newly synthesized myelin proteins and quantitative proteome shifts are consistent with remyelination underlying restoration in optic nerve function. These results suggest that exogenous LPC 18:1 may provide a therapeutic avenue for stemming vision loss in demyelinating diseases.

Despite the popularity of studies in this area recently, there is currently still no sufficient treatment for it. Knowledge on how ZIKV infection impact human metabolisms is still lacking. Untargeted metabolomics can profile the overall change in metabolites after infection, thus provide hypothesis for specific investigations. We here performed a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based untargeted case-control metabolomics study on urine of ZIKV-infected pregnant women. We collected samples monthly from the first trimester till up to 6 months of ZIKV-infected and non-infected individuals and modelled the longitudinal data. We identified 3-aminoisobutyrate and trigonelline with significantly higher levels in the ZIKV-infected patients, while 11 metabolites (fucose, 2-hydroxyglutarate, N-acetyl-glutamine, dimethylamine, 4-hydroxyphenethyl alcohol, creatinine, lactate, threonine, histidine, pseudouridine, and 1-methylnicotinamide) had significantly lower levels. We also identified 2 metabolites, including glucose and 1-methylnicotinamide, where the trends over time of the intensity levels between the two groups were significantly different. These metabolites suggested further study on tryptophan, NAD+, pyrimidine, and glucose metabolisms. These metabolomic changes may lead us to a better understanding of mechanisms that cause poor fetal outcomes as well as effects of virus infection on human pregnancy.

Metabolomic characterization of purified cysts reveals global changes that comprise increased levels of amino acids and decreased abundance of nucleobase- and tricarboxylic acid cycle-associated metabolites.

Because these cell therapies can be harvested from different tissue sources, are manufactured ex vivo, and are composed of highly responsive cells from donors of varying demographics, significant complexities limit the current understanding and advancements to clinical practice. However, we propose a model workflow used to overcome challenges by identifying multi-omic features that can serve as predictive therapeutic outcomes of MSCs. Here, features were identified using unbiased symbolic regression and machine learning models that correlated multi-omic datasets to results from in vitro functional assays based on putative mechanisms of action of MSCs. Together, this study provides a compelling framework for achieving the identification of candidate CQAs specific to MSCs that may help overcome current challenges, advancing MSCs to broad clinical use. This upload contains the metabolomic dataset which were correlated with quality metrics, such as potency.

Cancer therapies generate stress signals that act upon mitochondria to initiate apoptosis. Mitochondria isolated from neuroblastoma cells were exposed to tBid or Bim, death effectors activated by therapeutic stress. Multidrug resistant tumor cells obtained from children at relapse had markedly attenuated Bak and Bax oligomerization and cytochrome c release (surrogates for apoptotic commitment) in comparison with patient-matched tumor cells obtained at diagnosis. Electron microscopy identified reduced endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contacts (ERMCs) in therapy resistant cells, and genetically or biochemically reducing ERMCs in therapy sensitive tumors phenocopied resistance. ERMCs serve as platforms to transfer Ca2+ and bioactive lipids to mitochondria. Reduced Ca2+ transfer was found in some but not all resistant cells, and inhibiting transfer did not attenuate apoptotic signaling. In contrast, reduced ceramide synthesis and transfer was common to resistant cells and its inhibition induced stress resistance. We identify ERMCs as physiologic regulators of apoptosis via ceramide transfer and uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism for cancer multidrug resistance.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001300	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8P69K			Metabolomic Profiling of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Differentiation into Lung Progenitors	Metabolism is vital to cellular function and tissue homeostasis during human lung development. In utero, embryonic pluripotent stem cells undergo endodermal differentiation towards a lung progenitor cell fate that can be mimicked in vitro using induced human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to study genetic mutations. To identify differences between wild type and surfactant protein B (SFTPB)-deficient cell lines during endoderm specification towards lung, we used an untargeted metabolomics approach to evaluate the developmental changes in metabolites. We found that the metabolites most enriched during the differentiation from pluripotent stem cell to lung progenitor cell, regardless of cell line, were sphingomyelins and phosphatidylcholines, two important lipid classes in fetal lung development. The SFTPB mutation had no metabolic impact on early endodermal lung development. The identified metabolite signatures during lung progenitor cell differentiation may be utilized as biomarkers for normal embryonic lung development.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001301	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8JH7P			Integrated multilayer omics reveals the genomic, proteomic and metabolic influences of the histidyl dipeptides on heart	Histidyl dipeptides, such as carnosine, present in a micro-millimolar ranges in the heart, are synthesized via the enzyme carnosine synthase (Carns). These dipeptides facilitate glycolysis by proton buffering, form conjugates with reactive aldehydes, such as acrolein, and attenuate ischemia and reperfusion injury. While these dipeptides exhibit multifunctional properties, a composite understanding of their roles in myocardium is lacking. To identify the landscape of histidyl dipeptide mediated responses in the heart, we used a triomics approach of genome wide RNA sequencing, global proteomics and unbiased metabolomics in the cardio specific Carns transgenic (Tg) mice and integrated the three data sets. Our result show higher myocardial levels of histidyl dipeptides lead to extensive changes in several microRNAs, which could target the expression of contractile proteins, beta-fatty acid oxidation and citric acid cycle (TCA) enzymes. Global proteomics shows, expression of contractile proteins, enzymes of beta-fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle, were enriched in the CarnsTg heart. Under aerobic conditions, the CarnsTg hearts had lower levels of short and long-chain fatty acids and TCA cycle intermediate-succinic acid, whereas, under ischemic conditions the accumulation of fatty acids and TCA cycle intermediates were significantly attenuated in the CarnsTg heart. Integration of multiple data sets suggests that beta-fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle pathways exhibited correlative changes in the CarnsTg hearts at all three levels. Our triomics approach shows histidyl dipeptides are critical regulators of myocardial structure, function and energetics.

A common technique to induce in vitro steatosis involves culturing primary human hepatocytes (PHH) in a fatty acid-enriched media. This study compared the lipidome of PHH cultured in a fatty acid-enriched media to hepatocytes from patients with NASH and healthy controls to determine whether such culture techniques could generate a hepatocellular lipid profile similar to that observed in NASH patients. LC-MS lipidomics analysis of hepatocytes from patients with NASH revealed increases in the total cellular abundance of glycerolipids, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidylserines compared to healthy control hepatocytes. PHH cultured in a fatty acid-enriched environment demonstrated an increase in total lipid abundance, however, changes were limited to glycerolipids; in contrast to NASH hepatocytes, increases in the abundance of phospholipids were not observed.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001303	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M89135			Unchecked oxidative stress is an insurmountable barrier for tumour cells that disseminate to skeletal muscle	Skeletal muscle has been recognized as an inhospitable site for disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) for decades, yet its antimetastatic nature has eluded a thorough mechanistic description. Here, we show that DTCs traffic to and persist within skeletal muscle, raising the question as to how this tissue suppresses colonization. We employed mouse and organotypic culture models along with metabolomic profiling and ultimately find that oxidative stress is a principal suppressor of DTC proliferation in skeletal muscle. DTCs bypassed this oxidative constraint upon colonization of more fertile sites, but were unable to in muscle. Functional studies demonstrated that disrupting redox homeostasis via chemogenetic induction of reactive oxygen species slowed proliferation in lung. Conversely, enhancing antioxidant potential of tumour cells via ectopic expression of catalase allowed robust colonization of skeletal muscle. These findings reveal a profound metabolic bottleneck imposed on DTCs and sustained by skeletal muscle. Understanding this biology could reveal novel DTC vulnerabilities.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001304	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8570V			Pollen metabolomics using Arabidopsis thaliana: Comparison of pollen at mature, hydration and germination stage	Pollen germination is an essential process for pollen tube growth, pollination, and therefore seed production in flowing plants, which requires energy either from remobilization of stored carbon sources, lipid and starch, or from secreted exudates from stigma. Transcriptome analysis from in vitro pollen germination previously showed 14 GO terms, including metabolism and energy, which are overrepresented in Arabidopsis. However, the global changes of carbohydrate and energy-related metabolites during the transition from mature pollen grain to hydrated pollen, the prerequisite step to pollen germination, is poorly understood in Arabidopsis. In this study, we investigated the differential metabolic pathway enrichment among mature, hydrated, and germinated pollen using untargeted metabolomics analysis. Integration of publicly available transcriptome with presented metabolome data revealed starch and sucrose metabolism was significantly increased during pollen hydration and germination. The alterations in central metabolism focusing on sugar, fatty acids, and lipids were analyzed in detail. Several metabolites, including palmitic acid, oleic acid, linolenic acid, quercetin, luteolin/kaempferol, and ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA), were elevated in the hydrated pollen, suggesting a potential role in activating pollen tube emergence. The metabolite levels of mature, hydrated, and germinated pollen, presented in this work provide insights on the molecular basis of pollen germination.

However, 5C(M+5) labeled-aKG showed a higher ratio in IL-4-treated Sirt3 KR macrophages than that in IL-4-treated Sirt3 WT macrophages, suggesting that SENP1-Sirt3 axis mainly involves the conversion of glutamate to aKG of glutaminolysis in macrophage M2 polarization.

Our objective was to explore the effects of acute intravenous LPS administration on metabolism in late-lactation Holstein cows experiencing hyperlipidemia. Ten non-pregnant lactating Holstein cows (273 ± 35 d in milk) were administered a single bolus of saline (3 mL of saline; n = 5) or LPS (0.375 µg of LPS/kg of body weight; n = 5). Simultaneously, cows were intravenously infused a triglyceride emulsion and fasted for 16 h to induce hyperlipidemia in an attempt to model the periparturient period. Blood was sampled at routine intervals. Changes in circulating total fatty acid concentrations and inflammatory parameters were measured. Plasma samples were analyzed using untargeted lipidomics and metabolomics. Endotoxin increased circulating serum amyloid A, LPS-binding protein, and cortisol concentrations. Endotoxin administration decreased plasma lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) concentrations and increased select plasma ceramide concentrations. These outcomes suggest modulation of the immune response and insulin action. Lipopolysaccharide decreased the ratio of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanomanine, which potentially indicate a decrease in the hepatic activation of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase and triglyceride export. Endotoxin administration also increased plasma concentrations of pyruvic and lactic acids, and decreased plasma citric acid concentrations, which implicate the upregulation of glycolysis and downregulation of the citric acid cycle (i.e., the Warburg effect), potentially in leukocytes. Acute intravenous LPS administration decreased circulating LPC concentrations, modified ceramide and glycerophospholipid concentrations, and influenced intermediary metabolism in dairy cows experiencing hyperlipidemia.

The availability of glucose and glutamine in the TME are essential for the development and activation of effector T cells that exert anti-tumor function. Recently, inhibition of glutaminase, the enzyme that hydrolyzes glutamine to glutamate, has garnered interest as an approach to both decrease tumor metabolism and growth, while increasing available glutamine in the TME for effector T cells. Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy unleashes anti-tumor effector capabilities of T cells, and although there are good responses in many solid tumors, a significant proportion of patients respond poorly. In lung adenocarcinoma, response to immunotherapy is reported to be impaired in KRAS-mutant patients harboring concurrent KEAP1 and STK11/Lkb1 mutations. To investigate the metabolism and immune microenvironment of KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma, we generated a series of murine models that reflect the KEAP1 and STK11/Lkb1 mutational landscape seen in patients. Here we show increased glutamate abundance in the Lkb1-deficient TME associated with CD8 T cell activation in response to anti-PD1 checkpoint immunotherapy. Combination treatment with the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 inhibited clonal expansion and cytotoxic activation of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells. Thus, CD8 T cells exposed to checkpoint immunotherapy have a dependence on glutamine and reliance on glutaminase activity and are negatively impacted by the glutaminase inhibitor in this highly activated state. Therefore, we discern that the combination of immunotherapy and glutaminase inhibition is not efficacious for CD8 T cell activation in the tumor microenvironment.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001309	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8HH60			Time-Resolved Metabolomics of a Mouse Model of Ovarian High-Grade Serous Carcinoma .	The dismally-low survival rate of ovarian cancer patients diagnosed with high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) emphasizes the lack of effective screening strategies. One major obstacle is the limited knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of HGSC pathogenesis at very early stages. Here, we present the first 10-month time-resolved serum metabolic profile of a triple mutant (TKO) HGSC mouse model, along with the spatial lipidome profile of its entire reproductive system. A high-coverage liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach was applied to longitudinally-collected serum samples from both TKO and TKO control mice, tracking metabolome and lipidome changes from disease onset until death. Spatial lipid distributions within the reproductive system were also mapped via ultrahigh-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry, and compared with serum lipid profiles for various lipid classes. Altogether, our results show that the remodeling of lipid and fatty acid metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, TCA cycle and ovarian steroidogenesis are critical components of HGSC onset and development. These metabolic alterations are accompanied by changes in energy metabolism, mitochondrial and peroxisomal function, redox homeostasis, and inflammatory response, collectively supporting tumorigenesis.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001310	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8CT43			Mutant CHCHD10 causes an extensive metabolic rewiring that precedes OXPHOS dysfunction in a murine model of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy	Mitochondrial cardiomyopathies are fatal diseases, with no effective treatment. Alterations of heart mitochondrial function activate the mitochondrial integrated stress response (ISRmt), a transcriptional program affecting cell metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and proteostasis. In humans, mutations in CHCHD10, a mitochondrial protein with unknown function, were recently associated with dominant multi-system mitochondrial diseases, whose pathogenic mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, in CHCHD10 knock-in mutant mice, we identify an extensive cardiac metabolic rewiring triggered by proteotoxic ISRmt. The stress response arises early on, before the onset of bioenergetic impairments, triggering a switch from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism, enhancement of transsulfuration and one carbon (1C) metabolism, and widespread metabolic imbalance. In parallel, increased NADPH oxidases elicit antioxidant responses leading to heme depletion. As the disease progresses, the adaptive metabolic stress response fails, resulting in fatal cardiomyopathy. Our findings suggest that early interventions to counteract metabolic imbalance could ameliorate mitochondrial cardiomyopathy associated with proteotoxic ISRmt.

In this study, we evaluated the lipidomic profile of two-dimensional (2D) monolayer and multicellular tumor spheroids from the HCT 116 colon carcinoma cell line. We utilized serial trypsinization on the spheroid samples to generate three cellular populations representing the proliferative, quiescent, and necrotic regions of the spheroid. This analysis enabled a comprehensive identification and quantification of lipids produced in each of the spheroid layer and 2D cultures. We show that lipid subclasses associated with lipid droplets form in oxygen-restricted and acidic regions of spheroids and are produced at higher levels than in 2D cultures. Additionally, sphingolipid production, which is implicated in cell death and survival pathways, is higher in spheroids relative to 2D cells. Finally, we show that increased numbers of lipids comprised of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are produced in the quiescent and necrotic regions of the spheroid. The lipidomic signature for each region and cell culture type highlights the importance of understanding the spatial aspects of cancer biology. These results provide additional lipid biomarkers in the tumor microenvironment that can be further studied during potential therapeutic studies which target pivotal lipid production pathways.

Here, we show that the histone deacetylase SIRT6 regulates tumor initiation during intestinal cancer by controlling glucose metabolism. Loss of SIRT6 results in increased number of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), which translates into enhanced tumor initiating potential in APCmin mice. More importantly, we found a metabolic compartmentalization within the intestinal epithelium and adenomas, where a rare population of cells exhibit features of Warburg-like metabolism characterized by high pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activity. Our results show that these cells are quiescent cells expressing +4 ISCs and enteroendocrine markers. Active glycolysis in these cells suppresses ROS accumulation and enhances their stem cell and tumorigenic potential. Our studies reveal that aerobic glycolysis represents a highly heterogeneous feature of cancer, and more importantly, they indicate that this metabolic adaptation occurs in non-dividing cells, suggesting a role for the Warburg effect beyond biomass production in tumors.

Here, we elucidated the metabolome of H9c2 cardioblasts by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry during ferroptosis induced by RSL3, a GPX4 inhibitor, in the presence of ferrostatin-1 (a ferroptosis inhibitor), XJB-5-131 (a mitochondrial-targeted ROS scavenger), or TSM-1005-44 (a newly developed cellular ROS scavenger). Results demonstrated that RSL3 decreased the levels of amino acids involved in glutathione synthesis more than two-fold. In contrast, saturated fatty acids levels were markedly increased in RSL3-challenged cells, with no effects on unsaturated fatty acids. RSL3 significantly altered the levels of mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates; isocitrate and 2-oxoglutarate were found to increase, whereas succinate was significantly decreased in RSL3-challenged cells. Ferrostatin-1, XJB-5-131, and TSM-1005-44 prevented RSL3-induced cell death and conserved the metabolomic profile of the cells. Since 2-oxoglutarate is involved in the regulation of ferroptosis, particularly through glutamine metabolism, we further assessed the role of glutaminolysis in ferroptosis in H9c2 cardioblasts. Genetic silencing of GLS1, which encodes the K-type mitochondrial glutaminase (glutaminase C), protected against ferroptosis in the early stage. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that RSL3-induced ferroptosis impairs the metabolome of H9c2 cardioblasts.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001321	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8ZM5P			Dynamic Lipidome Alterations Associated with Human Health, Disease, and Aging	Lipids comprise a complex mixture of molecules that play central but undercharacterized roles across a wide range of functions such as cell membrane maintenance, energy management, and cell signaling. Here, we describe a comprehensive longitudinal lipidomic profiling approach aiming to provide new physiological insights into aging, diabetes, inflammation, and cytokine regulations. By profiling the plasma lipidome to a depth of more than 800 lipid species across 1,546 samples collected from 109 subjects spanning up to 9 years (3.2 average), we identified a myriad of dysregulated lipid species highly associated with transitions from health to disease. Our data suggest distinct physiological roles of complex lipid subclasses including large and small triacylglycerols (TAG), ester- and ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE). The dynamic changes in the plasma lipidome under the conditions of respiratory viral infections, insulin resistance (IR), and aging indicate a putative role of these different lipids in regulating immune homeostasis in health as well as in acute and chronic inflammation. Moreover, metabolically unhealthy subjects diagnosed with IR show (1) disturbed immune homeostasis and differences in specific lipid-clinical measure associations, (2) altered dynamics for particular complex lipids including TAGs, LPCs PEs, and PCs in response to acute infections, and (3) elevated levels of complex lipids such as TAGs and CEs and accelerated aging, highlighting the importance of context specific interpretation of lipid profiles. Overall, our study exemplifies the power of deep and quantitative lipidomics profiling in conjunction with other omics measures to provide new insights into lipidome dynamics in health and disease.

Yet recognising dying is difficult and predicting dying frequently inaccurate. Methods: Serial urine samples from patients (n=112) with lung cancer were analysed using high resolution untargeted mass spectrometry. ANOVA and volcano plot analysis demonstrated metabolites that changed in the last weeks of life. Further analysis identified potential biological pathways affected. Cox lasso logistic regression was engaged to develop a multivariable model predicting the probability of survival within the last 30 days of life. Results: In total 124 metabolites changed. ANOVA analysis identified 93 metabolites and volcano plot analysis 85 metabolites. 53 metabolites changed using both approaches. Pathways altered in the last weeks included those associated with decreased oral intake, muscle loss, decreased RNA and protein synthesis, mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupted ß-oxidation and one carbon metabolism. Epinephrine and cortisol increased in the last 2 weeks and week respectively. A model predicting time to death using 7 metabolites had excellent accuracy (AUC= 0.86 at day 30, 0.88 at day 20 and 0.85 at day 10) and enabled classification of patients at low, medium and high risk of dying on a Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Conclusions: Metabolomic analysis identified metabolites and their associated pathways that change in the last weeks and days of life in patients with lung cancer. Prognostic tests based on the metabolites identified have the potential to change clinical practice and improve the care of dying patients.

The data show that vaccination does not induce any significant variation in the metabolome, whereas it causes changes at the level of lipoproteins. The effects are different in the COVID-19-recovered subjects with respect to the naïve subjects, suggesting that a previous infection reduces the vaccine modulation of the lipoproteome composition.

In 28 post-acute COVID-19-positive patients, the metabolites levels are reverted back to normality whereas the lipoprotein parameters are still altered. Therefore, the metabolite biomarkers might be used as the timeliest sign of the individual response to treatment or spontaneous healing.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001329	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8XM74			Lipidomics of High Fat vs Control Mice	Obesity exacerbates inflammation upon lung injury; however, the mechanisms by which obesity primes pulmonary dysregulation prior to injury are not well studied. Notably, little is known about how obesity dysregulates pulmonary polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism that is central to inflammation initiation and resolution. Herein, we first show with mass spectrometry that a high fat diet (HFD) administered to C57BL/6J mice increases the relative abundance of pulmonary PUFA-containing triglycerides and the concentration of PUFA-derived oxylipins, independent of an increase in total pulmonary PUFAs. Experiments with a genetic model of obesity did not recapitulate the effects of the HFD on the pulmonary oxylipin signature, suggesting a diet-driven effect. Subsequent pulmonary next-generation RNA sequencing showed complex and unique transcriptional regulation with a HFD. The HFD increased pathways related to glycerophospholipid metabolism, innate immunity, and inflammation including an elevation in B cell differentiation and signaling. Finally, computational integration of lipidomic with transcriptomic data revealed novel networks with the HFD between glycerophospholipid metabolism and B cell receptor signaling with specific oxylipins. Collectively, these data show obesity dysregulates pulmonary PUFA metabolism prior to lung injury, which may be a mechanism by which obesity primes the lungs to respond poorly upon infectious and/or inflammatory challenges.

The molecular features and associated biological functions of this phenotype remain poorly understood. We developed carboplatin resistant cell line models using OVCAR5 and CaOV3 cell lines with the aim of identifying chemoresistance-specific molecular features. Chemotaxis and CAM invasion assays revealed enhanced migratory and invasive potential in OVCAR5 resistant, compared to parental cells lines. Mass spectrometry analysis was used to analyse the proteome and metabolome of these cell lines and was able to separate these populations based on their molecular features. It revealed signalling and metabolic perturbations in chemoresistant cell lines. Comparison with the proteome of patient derived primary ovarian cancer cells grown in culture showed a shared dysregulation of cytokine and type 1 interferon signalling, potentially revealing a common molecular feature of chemoresistance. A comprehensive analysis of a larger patient cohort, including advanced in vitro and in vivo models, promises to help better understand the molecular mechanisms of chemoresistance and associated enhancement of migration and invasion.

Accordingly, drugs with novel modes of action are desperately required to combat malaria. P. falciparum parasites infect human red blood cells where they digest the hosts main protein constituent, hemoglobin. Leucine aminopeptidase PfA-M17 is one of several aminopeptidases that have been implicated in the last step of this digestive pathway. Here we utilize both reverse genetics and a compound specifically designed to inhibit the activity of PfA-M17 to show that PfA-M17 is essential for P. falciparum survival as it provides parasites with free amino acids for growth, many of which are highly likely to originate from hemoglobin. We further show that our inhibitor is on-target for PfA-M17 and has the ability to kill parasites at nanomolar concentrations. Thus, in contrast to other hemoglobin-degrading proteases that have overlapping redundant functions, we validate PfA-M17 as a potential novel drug target.

We assessed the safety of administering combination hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with anti-PDL-1 neoadjuvantly followed by adjuvant anti-PDL-1 with standard of care therapy (n=21). The primary endpoint of the study was safety, which was met. Secondary endpoints included radiographic, pathologic, and objective response, locoregional control (LRC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Among evaluable patients at early median follow-up of 16 months (448 days), OS was 83.3%, LRC and PFS were 83.3%, and major pathological response (MPR) or complete response (CR) was 75%. Circulating CD8/Treg ratio, CD4 effector memory T cells, and TCR repertoire emerged as biologic correlates of response to therapy. Using high-dimensional multi-omics and spatial data as well as biological correlatives pre- and post-treatment, three major changes were noted in responders within the tumor microenvironment (TME) (and within the blood) post-treatment: 1) an increase in effector T cells; 2) a decrease in immunosuppressive cells; and 3) an increase in antigen presentation. Non-responders appeared to fail due to a lack of one of these three identified steps needed for priming and maintaining activation of T cells. Multiple correlates for response, along with subsets of non-responders that may benefit from additional or alternative immunotherapies, were identified. This treatment is being tested in an ongoing phase II trial with a similar design, where we hope to confirm and expand on our understanding of the mechanisms underlying resistance to therapy.

Untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) profiling was performed using fractionation on a Vanquish Horizon Binary UHPLC. Subsequent analyses were performed on an inline coupled Q-Exactive Orbitrap instrument. Metabolites were identified using Compound DiscovererTM software.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001340	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8HD8Q			A ferroptosis defense mechanism mediated by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2 in mitochondria	Mechanisms of defense against ferroptosis (an iron-dependent form of cell death induced by lipid peroxidation) in cellular organelles remain poorly understood, hindering our ability to target ferroptosis in disease treatment. In this study, metabolomic analyses revealed that treatment of cancer cells with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibitors results in intracellular glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) depletion. We further showed that supplementation of cancer cells with G3P attenuates ferroptosis induced by GPX4 inhibitors in a G3P dehydrogenase 2 (GPD2)-dependent manner; GPD2 deletion sensitizes cancer cells to GPX4 inhibition-induced mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, and combined deletion of GPX4 and GPD2 synergistically suppresses tumor growth by inducing ferroptosis in vivo. Mechanistically, inner mitochondrial membrane-localized GPD2 couples G3P oxidation with ubiquinone reduction to ubiquinol, which acts as a radical-trapping antioxidant to suppress ferroptosis in mitochondria. Taken together, these results reveal that GPD2 participates in ferroptosis defense in mitochondria by generating ubiquinol.

NMR metabolomics provides a powerful tool to investigate the metabolic perturbations induced by Pt drugs in cancer cells and decipher their meaning in relation to the presumed molecular mechanisms. We have carried out a systematic and comparative NMR metabolomics study to analyze the responses of A2780 human ovarian cancer cells to the main clinically established Pt drugs, i.e. cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin, with a particular attention for the oxaliplatin/cisplatin comparison in view of recently described mechanistic differences. Notably, NMR analysis revealed some moderate and consistent changes in the metabolomic profiles of A2780 cells treated with the 3 Pt drugs with respect to controls but only very small differences among them. Beyond the expected alterations at the level of the nucleic acids the observed changes highlight in all cases induction of a significant ER stress. Owing to the clinical relevance of platinum resistance the behavior of a cisplatin resistant A2780 cancer cell line upon cisplatin treatment was also evaluated.

Through HHEAR, targeted and untargeted (metabolomics) analyses will characterize exposure to metals in a sub-cohort of pregnant women for whom exposure data are not yet available. This expanded exposure analysis will enable a more comprehensive cumulative risk assessment of adverse birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes in the overall cohort.

We previously identified the small molecule CID661578 as a potent inducer of beta-cell regeneration but its target and mechanism of action have remained unknown. We now screened 257 million yeast clones and determined that CID661578 targets MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (MNK2), an interaction we genetically validated in vivo. CID661578 increased beta-cell neogenesis from ductal cells in zebrafish, neonatal pig islet aggregates and human pancreatic ductal organoids. Mechanistically, we found that CID661578 boosts protein synthesis and regeneration by blocking MNK2 from binding eIF4G in the translation initiation complex at the mRNA cap. Unexpectedly, this blocking activity augmented eIF4E-phosphorylation depending on MNK1 and bolstered the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G, which is necessary for both hypertranslation and beta-cell regeneration. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a targetable role of MNK2-controlled translation in beta-cell regeneration, a role that warrants further investigation in diabetes.

In this study, we performed ultraperformance liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) based metabolic profiling of 227 tissue samples from 79 lung cancer patients with adenocarcinoma (AC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). oPLS-DA analysis showed detections of AC, SCC and NSCLC were possible with good accuracies (91.3%, 100% and 88.3%), sensitivities (85.7%, 100% and 83.9%), and specificities (94.3%, 100% and 90.7%), respectively. Valine, sphingosine, Glu ?-methyl ester and LPC 16:0 contributed to AC detection and significantly altered in tumor. Valine, sphingosine, LPC 18:1 and leucine derivative contributed to SCC detection. Classification of AC and SCC was also possible (accuracy of 96.8%, sensitivity of 98.2% and specificity of 85.7%) with a panel of 5 metabolites, of which valine and creatine were significantly changed. The classification models were confirmed with external validation sets, showing promise for NSCLC detection and subtyping.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) adapt their metabolism to maintenance and proliferation, but the mechanism remains incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrated that homeostatic HSCs had high amino acid (AA) catabolism to reduce the cellular AA levels, which activated the GCN2-eIF2a axis, a protein-synthesis-inhibitory checkpoint to inhibit protein synthesis for maintenance. Furthermore, upon proliferation conditions, HSCs increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for higher energy production but decreased AA catabolism to accumulate cellular AAs, which inactivated the GCN2-eIF2a axis to increase protein synthesis and coupled with proteotoxic stress. Importantly, GCN2 deletion impaired HSC function in repopulation and regeneration. Mechanistically, GCN2 maintained proteostasis and inhibited Src mediated AKT activation to repress mitochondrial OXPHOS in HSCs. Moreover, glycolytic metabolite, NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR), accelerated AA catabolism to activate GCN2 and sustain long-term function of HSCs. Overall, our study uncovers the direct links between metabolic alterations and translation control in HSCs during homeostasis and proliferation.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001350	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M86X36			Optimization of Imputation Strategies for High-Resolution Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HR GC-MS) Metabo-lomics Data	Gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been used in biomedical research to analyze volatile, non-polar, and polar metabolites in a wide array of sample types. Despite advances in technology, missing values are still common in metabolomics datasets and must be properly handled. We evaluated the performance of ten commonly used missing value imputa-tion methods with metabolites analyzed on an HR GC-MS instrument. By introducing missing values into the complete (i.e., data without any missing values) NIST plasma dataset we demon-strate that Random Forest (RF), Glmnet Ridge Regression (GRR), and Bayesian Principal Com-ponent Analysis (BPCA) shared the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in technical repli-cate data. Further examination of these three methods in data from baboon plasma and liver samples demonstrated they all maintained high accuracy. Overall, our analysis suggests that any of the three imputation methods can be applied effectively to untargeted metabolomics datasets with high accuracy. However, it is important to note that imputation will alter the correlation structure of the dataset, and bias downstream regression coefficients and p-values.

We are interested in differences/correlations between family samples over time, and the extent to which maternal exposures impact the lipidomes and metabolomes of both family members. Three plasma samples were analyzed from each family: two maternal samples (from first trimester and time of admission for labor and delivery) and one child sample (from cord blood). Placentas were also collected. Mothers provided detailed demographic information and clinical phenotypes were obtained, including mid-gestation fetal ultrasound.

The lack of effective screening strategies for high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), a subtype of ovarian cancer (OC) responsible for 80% of OC related deaths, emphasizes the need for new diagnostic markers and a better understanding of disease pathogenesis. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) offers high selectivity and sensitivity, thereby increasing metabolite coverage and consequently enhancing biomarker discovery. Recent advances in CE-MS include small, chip-based CE systems coupled with nanoelectrospray ionization (nanoESI) to provide rapid, high-resolution analysis of biological specimens. Here, we describe the development of a targeted microchip (µ) CE-HRMS method to analyze 40 target metabolites in serum samples from a triple-mutant (TKO) mouse model of HGSC, with an acquisition time of only 3 min. Extracted ion electropherograms showed sharp, highly resolved peak shapes, even for structural isomers such as leucine and isoleucine. All analytes maintained good linearity with an average R2 of 0.994, while detection limits were in the nM range. Thirty metabolites were detected in mice serum, with recoveries ranging from 78 to 120 %, indicating minimal ionization suppression and good accuracy. We applied the µCE-HRMS method to sequentially-collected serum samples from TKO and TKO-control mice. Time-resolved analysis revealed characteristic temporal trends for amino acids, nucleosides, and amino acids derivatives associated with HGSC progression. Comparison of the µCE-HRMS dataset with non-targeted ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) – MS results revealed identical temporal trends for the 5 metabolites detected on both platforms, indicating the µCE-HRMS method performed satisfactorily in terms of capturing metabolic reprogramming due to HGSC progression, while reducing the total analysis time 3-fold.

This study reveals that selection for mitochondrial fitness occurs during B 56 cell activation and is essential for subsequent plasma cell differentiation. By expressing a 57 mutated mitochondrial helicase in transitional B cells, we depleted mitochondrial DNA during 58 B cell maturation, resulting in reduced oxidative phosphorylation. Although no changes in 59 follicular B cell development were evident, germinal centers, class switch recombination to 60 IgG, plasma cell maturation and humoral immunity were diminished. Defective oxidative 61 phosphorylation led to aberrant flux of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and lowered the amount of 62 saturated phosphatidic acid. Consequently, mTOR activity and BLIMP1 induction were 63 curtailed whereas HIF1? _and glycolysis were amplified. Exogenous phosphatidic acid 64 increased mTOR activity in activated B cells. Hence, mitochondrial function is required and 65 selected for in activated B cells for the successful generation of functional plasma cells.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001357	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M89Q66			A Metabolomics-guided Bioreactor for Improved Engineered Bone Implants (BioImplant)	In an “omic” era, metabolomics offers exquisite insight into the complex metabolic network of living organisms and their adaptation mechanisms towards disease, therapy and environment. Metabolic markers (sets of metabolites) are emerging as new means of diagnostics, personalized follow-up and prediction of patient health status. Here, metabolomics is used for the first time to guide the development of a stem cell (SC) bioreactor to produce improved quality bone tissue for implantation. 3D porous scaffolds will be produced using biodegradable polymer poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), both bare and collagen-coated to improve cell adhesion. These scaffolds will be 3D-printed with controlled architectures (both internally and externally), namely with struts alignment of 90o, with and without offset, expected to trigger distinct biological behaviors, particularly under mechanical cues. Scaffolds will be tested in a bioreactor for growth and differentiation of human mesenchymal SCs (hMSCs) into osteogenic lineage. hMSCs obtained from adipose tissue or bone marrow will be compared, as they have shown secretome differences and possible different potentials for osteogenic differentiation. The bioreactor will allow the application of controlled compression, to help mimic bone physiological conditions, and scaffold piezoelectricity will be studied in the same context. Scaffolds and physical cues will be tested in vitro (in osteogenic media) and monitored by biological measurements (proliferation, viability, differentiation indicators) and, for the first time, by cell metabolomics to identify the impact of each variable (scaffold composition, morphology, piezoelectricity and compression) on hMSC metabolism and define metabolic markers of hMSC function. Untargeted Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) metabolomics of cell extracts will identify dynamic metabolic cellular profiles associated to i) hMSC self-renewal and differentiation mechanisms, and their adaptations to ii) scaffold characteristics and iii) physical cues (compression and/or piezoelectricity). Statistical correlation of metabolic profiles with scaffold/bioreactor features and biological parameters will unveil metabolic markers of bioreactor performance and novel knowledge on SC osteogenic metabolism. Key metabolites will be identified as potentially osteogenesis-inducing, a role to be demonstrated using metabolite-tailored cell media to potentially substitute osteogenic growth factors and, thus, tackle related implantation challenges. Putative hypotheses of responsive hMSCs metabolic pathways will be validated through pathway network analysis, isotope-labeled tracers (NMR) and specific protein and genetic measurements. To our knowledge, this project proposes the first use of metabolomics to guide in vitro bone tissue engineering, building on recent proposals to exploit “omics” to understand, monitor and guide SC behavior for effective tissue engineering and implantation.

Below is taken from the abstract: Many studies have applied multivariate analysis to mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data to differentiate structures in a sample based on information of compound spatial distribution. However, the actual distribution of individual compounds remains poorly documented, especially in plant samples. Here, a detailed non-targeted approach for plant sample analysis applied for the study of compound distribution in the medicinal species, long pepper, which has complicated internal structure. Principal component analysis (PCA) discriminated between the seed and pericarp regions, resulting in peaks that were closely associated with each region. Investigation of these peaks revealed slight but potentially important distribution differences between them, despite sharing the same accumulation profile in a region. Furthermore, piperamides such as piperine and piperlonguminine were among the compounds closely associated with the pericarp region. This is the first study to report the utilization of PCA for spatial feature extraction and the localization of piperamides in dried long pepper.

The precise underlying molecular mechanisms of DN remain elusive. Accumulating recent evidence suggests that mitochondrial integrity and lipid metabolism in podocytes significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of DN. However, the interplay between these two key metabolic regulators of DN is not fully understood. This study examines the role of ChREBP (carbohydrate-response element-binding protein), a master regulator of lipogenesis, on mitochondrial morphology and progression of DN. Our findings suggest that diabetic mice with podocyte-specific deletion of ChREBP are protected against mitochondrial fragmentation and progression of DN. Using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified the central role of ChREBP-induced plasmalogen phospholipids in linking mitochondrial lipidomes with mitochondrial dynamics in DN.

Here, we combined biochemical and functional assays with single-molecule dynamic approaches to demonstrate that the local lipid environment regulates CXCR4 organization and function and modulates chemokine-triggered directed cell migration. Prolonged treatment of T cells with neutral sphingomyelinase promoted the complete and sustained breakdown of sphingomyelins and the accumulation of the corresponding ceramides, which altered both membrane fluidity and CXCR4 nanoclustering and dynamics. Under these conditions CXCR4 retained some CXCL12-mediated signaling activity but failed to promote efficient directed cell migration. Our data underscore a critical role for the local lipid composition at the cell membrane in regulating the lateral mobility of chemokine receptors, and their ability to dynamically increase receptor density at the leading edge to promote efficient cell migration.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001365	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M88Q5H			Metabolomics analysis of mouse liver with or without SIRT5 deficiency	Lysine succinylation is a post-translational modification that has been implicated in the regulation of various metabolic pathways. However, the biological relevance of lysine succinylation remains largely uncertain due to methodological difficulties in determining high-impact succinylation sites. In the present study, multiple high stoichiometry lysine sites were identified in argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1), a key enzyme in urea cycle, are regulated by SIRT5. Metabolomics profiling confirms that SIRT5 deficiency decreases urea cycle activity in liver. Importantly, SIRT5 deficiency compromises ammonia tolerance, and reduces locomotor and exploratory activity in male mice upon high-ammonium diet (HAD) feeding. Therefore, lysine succinylation plays a functionally important role in ammonia metabolism.

We previously reported the beneficial effects of a probiotic strain, Bifidobacterium breve MCC1274, on cognitive function in preclinical and clinical studies. Recently, we showed that administration of this strain reduced amyloid-beta production, inhibited microglial activation, and suppressed inflammatory responses in the brains of APP knock-in (AppNL-G-F) mice. To elucidate the mechanism of action of this probiotic strain in an Alzheimer's disease-like model, we orally fed 3-month-old mice with B. breve MCC1274 or saline for 4 months and comprehensively investigated metabolites in plasma using CE-FTMS and LC-TOFMS.

It is therefore essential to understand their interaction with cellular barriers such as skin. In this work we evaluated the metabolic changes in human skin cells (HaCaT) exposed to different GRMs for 7 and 30 days. Objectives Endogenous metabolic profiles of control and graphene-treated keratinocytes have been studied using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). Keratinocytes were treated with graphene oxide (GO) from two different suppliers and with few layer graphene (FLG). Samples were collected one week and one month after the start of the treatment. The general aim of the project was to evaluate potential metabolic differences between: 1) Graphene-treated keratinocytes and control keratinocytes at one week; 2) Graphene-treated keratinocytes and control keratinocytes at one month; 3) Control keratinocytes at 1 month and 1 week; 4) Graphene-treated keratinocytes at 1 month and 1 week. Experimental Procedures A successful metabolic profiling experiment relies on the ability to determine changes in an organism’s biofluid or tissue complement of metabolites. Mass spectrometry coupled to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC-MS) is well suited to such analyses due to its high sensitivity, large coverage over different classes of metabolites, high throughput capacity, and wide dynamic range. In this study, one UHPLC-MS based platform was used to analyse endogenous analytes for inclusion in subsequent statistical analysis procedures used to study metabolic differences between the groups of samples.

The mechanisms responsible for the pathological activation of neutrophils upon infiltration into tumors are not well defined, thus limiting the selective targeting of these cells. Tumor cells and immune cells engage in bi-directional manipulation of their respective metabolism, thereby altering cell function to facilitate tumor progression. Targeting the metabolism of responding immune cells can improve cancer treatment when combined with existing therapeutic strategies. Here, we investigated the role of metabolism in the immunoinhibitory actions of tumor PMN-MDSCs.

Although the effect of fructose on liver metabolism has been extensively studied, a significant portion of the fructose is first metabolized in the small intestine. Here we report that dietary fat enhances intestinal fructose metabolism, which releases glycerate into the blood. High systemic glycerate levels reduce pancreatic islet sizes and ß-cell content, thus inducing glucose intolerance. Our findings provide an additional link between dietary fructose and diabetes that is modulated by dietary fat.

Ciliopathies and retinal degenerative diseases are heterogeneous groups of genetic diseases. CFAP418 is a causative gene of both diseases, and its sequence is evolutionarily conserved. Here, we employ affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry and quantitative lipidomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic approaches to address the function of CFAP418 in retinas. We show CFAP418 unexpectedly binds to lipid metabolism precursor phosphatidic acid (PA) and mitochondrion-specific lipid cardiolipin but does not form a tight and static complex with proteins. Loss of Cfap418 leads to a widespread disruption of membrane lipid homeostasis and changes in protein-membrane association, which subsequently causes mitochondrial morphological and functional defects and membrane remodeling abnormalities in multiple vesicular trafficking pathways. The signaling of PA-binding protein kinase Ca is increased. Our results indicate that membrane lipid imbalance is a new pathological mechanism underlying inherited ciliopathies and retinal degenerations, which is associated with other known causative RAB28 and BBS genes.

Here we show that nicotinamide-N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is a novel host factor that mediates metabolic dysfunction in the livers of cancer-bearing mice. Multiple solid cancers distantly increase expression of Nnmt and its product 1-methylnicotinamide (MNAM) in the liver. Multi-omics analyses reveal suppression of the urea cycle accompanied by accumulation of amino acids, and enhancement of uracil biogenesis in the livers of cancer-bearing mice. Importantly, genetic deletion of Nnmt leads to alleviation of these metabolic abnormalities, and buffers cancer-dependent weight loss and reduction of the voluntary wheel-running activity. Our data also demonstrate that MNAM is capable of affecting urea cycle metabolites in the liver. These results suggest that cancers up-regulate the hepatic NNMT pathway to rewire liver metabolism towards uracil biogenesis rather than nitrogen disposal via the urea cycle, thereby disrupting host homeostasis.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001377	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8QQ6X			TMEM41B and VMP1 modulate cellular lipid and energy metabolism for facilitating Dengue virus infection	Lipid metabolism is an intricate yet crucial cellular process co-opted by multiple viruses for replication and biogenesis. Transmembrane Protein 41B (TMEM41B) and Vacuole Membrane Protein 1 (VMP1) are two recently identified ER-resident lipid scramblases that play a role in autophagosome formation and cellular lipid metabolism. Importantly, TMEM41B is also a newly validated host dependency factor required for productive infection of several medically important enveloped RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses and human coronaviruses. However, the exact underlying mechanism of TMEM414B in modulating viral infections remains an open question. Here, we uncovered that TMEM41B and VMP1 deficiencies severely impaired replication of flavivirus and human coronavirus via multiple parallel cellular mechanisms. In accordance with previous reports, we validated that both TMEM41B and VMP1 are indispensable for all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) to infect human cells, but not chikungunya virus, an alphavirus. Impaired dengue virus replication in TMEM41B and VMP1 deficient cells could induce a robust activation of innate immune RNA sensing as evidenced by hyperactivation of RIG-I and MDA5. However, this phenomenon was a consequence but not the root cause of the diminished viral replication. Notably, the impact of TMEM41B deficiency on DENV replication could be reversed by complementing the cells using exogenous unsaturated fatty acids, indicating a metabolic role for TMEM41B in flavivirus infection. Furthermore, we found that derailed cellular energy metabolism could be a contributing factor to block DENV infection as TMEM41B and VMP1 deficient cells harbored higher levels of compromised mitochondria that exhibited aberrant functions in facilitating beta-oxidation. Using lipidome and metabolome profiling of TMEM41B and VMP1 deficient cells, we further revealed that each of these genetic deficiencies result in distinctive cellular metabolic dysregulations, underlining their necessity for a balanced metabolic landscape, and strengthening the metabolic role of these ER membrane proteins in facilitating virus infection. Our results highlighted that TMEM41B and VMP1 are required for homeostasis of cellular metabolism, and this metabolic role contributes to their essentiality in facilitating DENV infection

To evaluate how breeding changed the metabolome of foxtail millet grains, we generated and analyzed datasets encompassing genomes, transcriptomes, metabolomes and anti-inflammatory indices from 398 foxtail millet accessions. We identified hundreds of common variants that influence numerous secondary metabolites, with significant heterogeneity in the natural variation of metabolites and their underlying genetic architectures between different sub-groups of foxtail millet. The combined results from variations in genome, transcriptome and metabolome illustrated how breeding has altered foxtail millet metabolite content. Selection for alleles of genes associated with yellow grains led to altered metabolite profiles, such as carotenoids and endogenous hormones. The importance of PSY1 (phytoene synthase 1) for millet color was validated using CRISPR-Cas9. The in vitro cell inflammation assay showed that 83 metabolites have anti-inflammatory effects. This multi-omics study illustrates how the breeding history of foxtail millet has impacted metabolites. It provides some fundamental resources for understanding how grain quality could be associated with different metabolites, and highlights future perspectives on millet genetic research and metabolome-assisted improvement.

Increased resistance and significant side effects continue to limit the efficacy of anti-BCa drugs, hence the need to identify new drug targets and to develop novel compounds to overcome these limitations. Nature-inspired anti-cancer compounds are becoming increasingly popular since they often provide a relatively safe and effective alternative. In this study, we employed multi-omics techniques to gain insights into the novel and potentially relevant mechanism of action of two recently identified nature- inspired anti-cancer compounds (SIMR 3066 and SIMR 3058). Discovery proteomics analysis combined with LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed on compound-treated vs. DMSO-treated control MCF-7 cells. Downstream protein functional analysis showed that most of the responsive proteins were functionally associated with antigen processing and neutrophil degranulation, RNA catabolism and protein folding as well as cytoplasmic vesicle lumen and mitochondrial matrix formation. Consistent with the proteomics findings, metabolomic pathway analysis suggested that SIMR compounds could alter metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, metabolomics-based enriched-for-action pathway analysis showed that the of two SIMR compounds associate with mercaptopurine and thioguanine and azathiprine. Lastly, joint proteomics and metabolomics analysis revealed that treatment of BCa with SIMR3066 disrupts several signaling pathways including such p53-mediated apoptosis and the circadian entertainment pathway. Overall, the multi-omics we used in this study seems potent at probing the mechanism of action of novel anti-cancer agents.

Thus, it is imperative to understand the cellular and molecular basis by which ROS impact on various biological and pathological processes. Here, we identified 2-oxindole, a tryptophan derivative, was a major catabolic product in hydrogen peroxide-treated cell culture medium. We used 2-oxindole to study its role in regulating AhR signaling and tryptophan metabolic pathways. We found that 2-oxindole significantly increased the activity of AhR, leading to enhanced expression of its downstream targets including cytochrome P450 genes.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001385	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8PT3H			Multiomics Analyses Reveal the Central Role of Pentose Phosphate Pathway in Resident Thymic Macrophages to Cope with Efferocytosis-Associated Stress	Tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) are heterogeneous cell populations found throughout the body. Depending on their location, they perform diverse functions maintaining tissue homeostasis and providing immune surveillance. To survive and function within, TRMs adapt metabolically to the distinct microenvironments. However, little is known about the metabolic signatures of TRMs. The thymus provides a nurturing milieu for developing thymocytes yet efficiently removes those that failed the selection, relying on the TRMs – resident thymic macrophages (TMfs). This study harnesses multiomics analyses to characterize TMfs and unveils their unique metabolic features. We find that the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is preferentially activated in TMfs, responding to the reduction-oxidation demands associated with the efferocytosis of dying thymocytes. The blockade of PPP in Mfs leads to decreased efferocytosis, which can be rescued by ROS scavengers. Our study reveals the key role of PPP in TMfs and underscores the importance of metabolic adaptation in supporting Mf efferocytosis.

In this report, we compared the potential therapeutic effects of pharmacological Beclin-1 activating peptide, TB-peptide, on the cardiac outcomes of young adult and aged mice during endotoxemia. We further examined alterations in myocardial metabolism induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge with and without the TB-peptide treatment. Methods and Results: C57BL/6J mice of 10-week and 24-month-old were challenged by LPS at doses at which cardiac dysfunction occurred. Following the treatment of TB-peptide or control vehicle, heart contractility, circulating cytokines, and myocardial autophagy were evaluated. A targeted metabolomics assay was applied to analyze cardiac metabolism. TB-peptide boosted autophagic response, attenuated cytokine production, and improved cardiac performance in both young and aged mice during endotoxemia. A targeted metabolomics assay was designed to detect a pool of 361 known metabolites, of which 156 were detected in at least one of the heart tissue samples. LPS-induced impairments were found in glucose and amino acid (AA) metabolisms in mice of all ages, and TB-peptide provided ameliorative effects to rescue these alterations. However, lipid metabolites were upregulated in the young group but moderately downregulated in the aged by LPS, suggesting an age-dependent response. TB-peptide mitigated LPS-mediated trend of lipids in the young mice but provided little effect on the aged ones. Conclusion: Pharmacological activation of Beclin-1 by TB-peptide protects the heart in both young and aged population during endotoxemia, suggest a therapeutic potential for sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. Metabolomics analysis suggests that this age-independent protection by TB-peptide is associated with reprograming of energy production via glucose and AA metabolisms.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of nitisinone on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolome in a murine model of AKU, with a view to providing additional insight into metabolic changes that occur following treatment with nitisinone. Methods: 17 CSF samples were collected from BALB/c Hgd-/-mice (n=8, treated with nitisinone – 4 mg/L and n=9, no treatment). Samples were diluted 1:1 with deionised water and analysed using a 1290 Infinity II liquid chromatography system coupled to a 6550 quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Agilent, Cheadle, UK). Raw data were processed using a targeted feature extraction algorithm and an established in-house accurate mass retention time database. Matched entities (±10 ppm theoretical accurate mass and ±0.3 minutes retention time window) were filtered based on their frequency and variability. Experimental groups were compared using a moderated t-test with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate adjustment. Results: Tyrosine, acetyl-tyrosine, ?-glutamyl-tyrosine, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactic acid were shown to increase in abundance (log2 fold change 2.6-6.9, 3/5 were significant p<0.05) in the mice that received nitisinone. Several other metabolites of interest were matched but no significant differences were observed, including the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tryptophan, and monoamine metabolites adrenaline, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol and octopamine. Conclusions: Evaluation of the CSF metabolome of a murine model of AKU showed a significant difference in the abundance of a limited number of metabolites. None of these have been reported in CSF from a murine model of AKU previously. Moreover this study confirms that some monoamine metabolites do not appear to be altered following nitisinone therapy.

The emergence of multidrug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum parasites presents a significant obstacle to the malaria elimination agenda. Resistance to piperaquine (PPQ), an important first-line partner drug, has spread across Southeast Asia where it has contributed to widespread treatment failures. The genetic cause of resistance to PPQ is attributable to a novel set of amino acid substitutions in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT). In this study, we used magnetically-purified trophozoite extracts from seven different lines comprising five genetically-modified and two field isolates. Three independent extractions with triplicate technical repeats were run by mass spectrometry on positive and negative modes and spectral peak raw data analyzed to obtain the fold change difference between the samples and parental control, Dd2Dd2crt. We show that PPQ-resistant, PfCRT mutant asexual blood stage parasites accumulate higher levels of hemoglobin-derived peptides than do their PPQ-sensitive counterparts.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001389	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85T47			Protective effects of maternal PQQ on hepatic lipid metabolism throughout the lifespan	Maternal obesity and consumption of a high-fat diet significantly elevate risk for pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), affecting 10% of children in the US. Almost half of these children are diagnosed with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a leading etiology for liver transplant. Animal models show that signs of liver injury and perturbed lipid metabolism asso-ciated with NAFLD begin in utero; however, safe dietary therapeutics to blunt developmental programming of NAFLD are unavailable. Using a mouse model of maternal Western-style diet (WD), we previously showed that pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a potent dietary antioxidant, protected offspring of WD-fed dams from development of NAFLD and NASH. Here, we used untargeted mass spectrometry-based lipidomics to delineate lipotoxic effects of WD on offspring liver and identify lipid targets of PQQ. PQQ exposure during pregnancy altered hepatic lipid profiles of WD-exposed offspring, upregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) a signaling and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to markedly attenuate triglyceride accumulation beginning in utero. Surprisingly, the abundance of very long-chain ceramides, important in promoting gut barrier and hepatic function, was significantly elevated in PQQ-treated offspring. PQQ exposure reduced the hepatic phosphatidylcho-line/phosphatidylethanolamine (PC/PE) ratio in WD-fed offspring and improved glucose toler-ance. Notably, levels of protective n - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were elevated in offspring exposed to PQQ, beginning in utero, and the increase in n - 3 PUFAs persisted into adulthood. Our findings suggest that PQQ supplementation during gestation and lactation augments pathways involved in the biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acids and plays a unique role in modifying specific bioactive lipid species critical for protection against NAFLD risk in later life.

We conducted a multi-site randomized, waitlist-controlled trial of an individualized exercise program for people at all stages of MM (n=60). Compared to the waitlist control group, participants of the 12-week intervention had significant improvement in health-related quality of life, mediated through improved MM symptoms, cardiorespiratory fitness and bone pain, with were mostly maintained at follow-up (up to 12 months).

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001391	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8X99S			Mitochondria regulate dietary lipid processing in enterocytes	Digested dietary fats are taken up, processed and transported by enterocytes to supply the body with lipids. Most absorbed lipids are assembled into pre-chylomicrons in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of enterocytes, which are then transported to the Golgi for maturation and subsequent secretion to the circulation. The role of mitochondria in regulating intestinal lipid transport remains unknown. Here we show that mitochondrial dysfunction in enterocytes inhibits chylomicron production and the transport of dietary lipids to peripheral organs. Mice with intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific ablation of the mitochondrial-specific aspartyl - tRNA synthetase DARS2, as well as of the respiratory chain subunit SDHA or the assembly factor COX10 failed to thrive and showed massive accumulation of lipids within large lipid droplets (LDs) in enterocytes of the proximal small intestine (SI). Feeding a fat-free diet inhibited the formation of LDs in DARS2-deficient enterocytes, showing that accumulating lipids derive mostly from digested fat. Furthermore, metabolic tracing studies revealed impaired transport of dietary lipids to peripheral organs in mice lacking DARS2 in IECs. Moreover, DARS2-deficient enterocytes showed a distinct lack of mature chylomicrons concomitant with a disorganisation of the Golgi apparatus, suggesting that impaired ER to Golgi trafficking underlies impaired chylomicron production and secretion. Taken together, these results revealed a vital role of mitochondria in regulating dietary lipid transport in enterocytes, which is relevant for understanding the intestinal and nutritional defects observed in patients with mitochondrial defects.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001392	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8SH87			Chaperonin CCT controls cell fueling by lipids and extracellular vesicle production through kinesin dynamics	Cells regulate their protein content through different processes including gene transcription, protein translation, post-translational modification, secretion, degradation and recycling. The complexity of this network and its dynamic regulation remains mostly unexplored. A plethora of intracellular elements can be incorporated into multivesicular bodies (MVB) to be secreted as soluble components or extracellular vesicles (EVs). By profiling the proteome of EVs from T cells, we have found the subunits of the chaperonin CCT, involved in the correct folding of particular proteins. By limiting CCT content after siRNA silencing, cells shift the dynamics of lipid droplets, peroxisomes and the endolysosomal system, showing an accumulation of MVBs that leads to increased EV production and an altered lipid composition. Also, their metabolic profile is shifted towards a lipid-dependent metabolism. This is exerted through the dynamic regulation of microtubule-based kinesin motor.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001393	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8NT4K			An early-life microbiota metabolite protects against obesity via intestinal PPAR-Gamma	The mechanisms by which the early-life microbiota protects against environmental factors that promote childhood obesity remain largely unknown. Using a mouse model in which young mice are simultaneously exposed to antibiotics and a high-fat diet, we show that Lactobacillus species, predominant members of the small intestine microbiota, regulate intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) to limit diet-induced obesity during early-life. A Lactobacillus-derived metabolite, phenyllactic acid (PLA), protected against metabolic dysfunction caused by early-life exposure to antibiotics and a high-fat diet by increasing the abundance of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) in the small intestine IECs. Therefore, PLA is a microbiota-derived metabolite that activates protective pathways in the small intestine epithelium to regulate fat absorption and prevent obesity during early life.

S. aureus utilizes two major transcriptional regulators, CodY and CcpA, to remodel metabolic and virulence gene expression in response to changing environmental conditions. Previous studies revealed that inactivation of either codY or ccpA has a pronounced impact on different aspects of staphylococcal physiology and pathogenesis. To determine the contribution and interplay of these two regulators in modulating central metabolism, virulence, and biofilm development we constructed and characterized codY ccpA double mutant in S. aureus UAMS-1. In line with previous studies, we found that CcpA and CodY control cellular metabolic status by altering carbon flow through the central and overflow metabolic pathways. Our results demonstrate that ccpA inactivation impairs biofilm formation and decreases incorporation of eDNA into the biofilm matrix while disrupting codY resulted in a robust structured biofilm tethered together with eDNA and PIA. Interestingly, inactivation of both codY and ccpA decreases biofilm biomass and neglects eDNA release in the double mutant. Compared to inactivation of codY, the codY ccpA mutant did not overexpress toxins but maintained overexpression of amino acid metabolism pathways. Furthermore, codY ccpA mutant produced higher amounts of PIA, in contrast to the wild-type strain and ccpA mutant. Overall, results of this study suggest that interplay between CodY and CcpA modulates central metabolism to optimize growth on preferred carbon sources while repressing virulence gene expression until nutrient limitation requires scavenging nutrients from the host

Recently, our group developed a new murine model to address the pathophysiology of access-related hand dysfunction (ARHD) in mice, where AVF creation is performed in the iliac artery/vein. Because of the anatomical location of the AVF creation, this model produces clinically relevant changes in the mouse hindlimb including hemodynamic alterations, muscle weakness, and mitochondrial function impairment.

We aim to study the effects and mechanisms of gut microbiota of obese subjects in contributing to CRC progression. Conventional AOM-treated and ApcMin/+ mice receiving feces from obese individuals showed significantly increased colon tumor formation compared with those receiving feces from control subjects. AOM-treated mice receiving feces from obese (OB-M) exhibited microbiota dysbiosis with enriched potential pathobionts Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium GAM147, Turicibacter sp. H121, Mucinivorans hirudinis, and depleted symbionts Bacteroides vulgatus, Faecalibaculum rodentium, Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus delbrueckii. The OB-M group also showed altered gut metabolites including elevated phenylacetic acid, and depleted genipin. Moreover, OB-M group showed impaired intestinal barrier function and significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of oncogenic Wnt signaling pathway. In conclusion, gut microbiota from obese individuals promotes colorectal carcinogenesis. Microbiota modulation in obese individuals may provide new insight into obesity-driven CRC prevention and therapy.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001398	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8141Z			Metabolic profiling at COVID-19 onset shows disease severity and sex-specific dysregulation	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes an acute respiratory disease, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been associated with high mortality and morbidity rates worldwide. However, the biological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced pathology are still not completely understood. This study aimed to characterize the metabolic and cytokine profile of COVID-19 patients at hospital admission and identify its association with the highest COVID-19 severity reached, as well as the differences by sex. We performed a metabolomics analysis in 129 COVID-19 patients enrolled from March to September 2020 at three hospitals in Madrid: Infanta Leonor University Hospital, del Tajo University Hospital, and Príncipe de Asturias University Hospital (although 123 fulfilled criteria and were used in statistical analysis), and a control group of 15 pre-pandemic healthy controls without any known infection. Patient samples were collected at hospital admission or within the first days after hospitalization and an untargeted plasma metabolic profiling (gas chromatography and capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (GC and CE-MS)) was performed. The primary outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19 patients versus healthy controls), COVID-19 symptomatology (hospitalized symptomatic patients (moderate plus severe) versus asymptomatic), and COVID-19 severe (severe versus moderate).

The improvement in our understanding of the mechanisms of how trees precisely can predict environmental threats and cope with these stresses benefits our natural selection or genetic improvement to the maintenance of forest sustainability. In this work, we investigate the metabolic changes in heat and drought combined stress in Pinus pinaster plantlets. Maritime pine is a coniferous tree with native populations distributed across the European Atlantic and Mediterranean basins and the north of Africa ranging from cool moist to warm dry climates. This species shows high plasticity and a contrasting adaptive capacity and resilience. This plasticity in the response to stress exposure may be associated with a differential ability to modulate their secondary metabolism. For this reason, the current study aims to investigate the gradual and synergetic metabolomic response using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based on untargeted metabolomic profiling of four stress levels. These metabolic profiles were supported by physiological and biochemical determinations. Our results showed that the metabolic profiles induced by low-stress exposition represent an adaptive conditioning mode with metabolome changes that help seedlings to cope with upcoming stress. The metabolism pathways involved in this response were mainly included in amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism leading to an enhanced accumulation of phenolics, flavonoids, and terpenoids. However, when the plantlets were exposed to higher-stress exposition, the secondary metabolites that starred the response are more complex and decorated, such as alkaloids, lignans, and glycosyloxyflavones. Those changes could help to maintain homeostasis and control the response magnitude on establishing and facilitating the plantlets’ survival. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the responsive mechanisms of the maritime pine under heat and drought stress in terms of metabolic profiles.

Fumarate is known to activate the anti-oxidant response and is key for cellular survival. Fumarate succinates KEAP1 which releases NRF2 to activate the antioxidant response. The role of fumarate on the global regulatory chromatin landscape is less understood. Here, by integrating chromatin accessibility and histone ChIP-seq profiles, we identify complex transcription factor networks involved in the highly remodelled chromatin landscape of FH-deficient cells. We implicate FOXA2 in the maintenance of FH-deficient cells by regulating anti-oxidant response genes and subsequent metabolic output, independent of NRF2. These results identify new redox and amino acid metabolism regulators and provide new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

This dataset focuses on hydrophilic metabolites and oxylipins and is part of the Human Trisome Project (HTP, http://www.trisome.org/) run by the Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. This data is generated from samples matched at the blood draw to multiple omics datasets including proteomics, cytokine profiling, RNA-seq, and mass cytometry. The HTP is an in-depth study of people with Down syndrome using the latest technologies in precision medicine. The goal of the HTP is to enable advanced therapeutic approaches to enhance the quality of life and extend the lifespan of those with trisomy 21 through the study of the co-occurring conditions of Down syndrome. The HTP leverages a multidisciplinary team of biomedical researchers, clinicians and data scientists located across multiple departments, divisions, institutes and centers at the University of Colorado who work together toward a single goal: to decipher why people with trisomy 21 have a different disease spectrum, being predisposed to some medical conditions while being protected from others. The HTP Biobank provides de-identified samples and clinical information to collaborators that are necessary for investigations that advance our understanding of several co-occurring medical conditions in Down syndrome. Studies using samples and data from the HTP Biobank are enabling the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutic approaches, serving not only individuals with Down syndrome, but also the billions worldwide affected by conditions that commonly co-occur in Down syndrome. This collaborative and multi-disciplinary model allows for one of the largest and most comprehensive studies of individuals with Down syndrome to date, including extensive characterization at the clinical, physiological, cellular and molecular levels.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001406	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M80421			Single Cell Spatial Analysis Reveals the Topology of Immunomodulatory Purinergic Signaling in Glioblastoma	Abstract from manuscript Glioblastoma develops an immunosuppressive microenvironment that fosters tumorigenesis and resistance to current therapeutic strategies. Here we use multiplexed tissue imaging and single-cell RNA-sequencing to characterize the composition, spatial organization, and clinical significance of extracellular purinergic signaling in glioblastoma. We show that glioblastoma exhibit strong expression of CD39 and CD73 ectoenzymes, correlating with increased adenosine levels. Microglia are the predominant source of CD39, while CD73 is principally expressed by tumor cells, particularly in tumors with amplification of EGFR and astrocyte-like differentiation. Spatially-resolved single-cell analyses demonstrate strong spatial correlation between tumor CD73 and microglial CD39, and that their spatial proximity is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Together, this data reveals that tumor CD73 expression correlates with tumor genotype, lineage differentiation, and functional states, and that core purine regulatory enzymes expressed by neoplastic and tumor-associated myeloid cells interact to promote a distinctive adenosine-rich signaling niche and immunosuppressive microenvironment potentially amenable to therapeutic targeting.

Fumarate hydratase (FH), a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyses the reversible hydration of fumarate to malate in the TCA cycle, has been identified as a bona fide tumour suppressor . FH loss predisposes to Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Carcinoma (HLRCC), a cancer syndrome characterized by the presence of benign tumours of the skin and uterus, and a highly aggressive form of renal cancer. Its loss leads to aberrant accumulation of fumarate, an oncometabolite that drives malignant transformation . Even though the link between FH loss, fumarate accumulation and HLRCC is well-known, the associated tumorigenic mechanism is it is still not fully understood. Indeed, although HLRCC tumours metastasize even when small, Fh1-deficient mice develop premalignant cysts in the kidneys, rather than overt carcinomas. Interestingly, these cysts are positive for the key tumour suppressor p21. Since p21 expression is a central trigger of cellular senescence, it is postulated that this process could be an obstacle for tumorigenesis in Fh1-deficient cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, HLRCC patients harbour the epigenetic suppression of p16, another key player of senescence. Here, we have confirmed that additional oncogenic events independent from a senescence bypass are required to allow full-blown transformation in FH deficient cells. Moreover, a genome wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen identified HIRA as a target that, when ablated, increases proliferation and invasion in Fh1-deficient cells. Moreover, Fh1 and Hira-deficient cells lead to the development of tumours and invasive features in the kidney in vivo. Strikingly, Hira depletion in Fh1 deficient cells controls the activation of a MYC and E2F-dependent transcriptional and metabolic program, which is known to play different oncogenic roles during tumour initiation and progression. Of note, the activation of these programs is independent of H3.3 deposition into the chromatin, known to be controlled by HIRA. Overall, we have identified a novel oncogenic event occurring in FH deficient tumours, which will be instrumental for understanding mechanisms of tumorigenesis in HLRCC and the development of targeted treatments.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001409	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8KT4Z			Lipolysis-derived Lipids Determine Autophagy Initiation during Fasting	For survival, autophagy is a crucial intracellular self-degradation process to provide energy sources, helping adapt to nutrient deprivation. Although nutrient availability is a key determinant of autophagy initiation, it remains elusive underlying mechanism(s) of perceiving nutritional scarcity by which cells timely turn on autophagy as the last self-destructive process for energy supply. Here, we showed that PKA-dependent lipolysis can block the initiation of futile autophagy during short-term nutritional deprivation by repressing AMPK. Using Raman microscopy imaging and metabolomics, we found that autophagy occurred by reduction in available free fatty acids (FFAs) for energy sources. By modulating genes involved in lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, we found that the use of lipolysis-derived FFAs precedes autophagy initiation. The dysregulated autophagy suppression during short-term fasting decreased motility and lifespan extension of worms. Taken together, these data suggest that PKA is a pivotal factor to orchestrate sophisticated catabolic pathways, preferring the use of PKA-mediated lipolytic products to repress futile autophagic degradation during short-term fasting through AMPK inhibition.

However, the mechanisms involved are not fully elucidated. According to the rank of residual feed intake (RFI)’s the social genetic effect (SGE), ten high and low pigs were selected, named LRI and HRI groups. The sampling of jejunal chyme after slaughter. 16S rRNA and LC-MS/MS were conducted to investigate the relationship between the gut microbiome or metabolites and the SGE of RFI. The results showed significant differences between HRI and LRI groups. Compared with the HRI group, Escherichia, Eubacterium, and Gemmiger were enriched in the LRI group (P < 0.01), whereas the abundance of Fusobacterium, Eubacterium, and Desulfovibrio in the HRI group were significantly higher than that in the LRI group (P < 0.01). In the metabolome, we found that Glycine, L-lysine, and L-tryptophan were positively correlated with RFI’s SGE. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that most differential metabolites were involved in amino acid metabolism. The Pearson correlation analysis of the candidate social biomarkers was carried out. Amino acid metabolites were discovered to have significant correlations with Escherichia and Fusobacterium. Therefore, Escherichia and Fusobacterium may influence the SGE of RFI through amino acid metabolism, thereby affecting feed efficiency.

It is speculated that public policies that have proven effective in limiting cigarette usage and facilitating cessation of its use resulted in the widespread use of alternative tobacco products (ATPs) as major forms of tobacco delivery systems. Previous studies have reported the acute effects of smoking medwak on altering the systolic blood pressure, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Smoking medwakh results in the release of a mixture of toxic chemicals including nicotine, carbon monoxide, and oxidizing gases 8-10. Inhalation of these toxic gases results in triggering of oxidative stress pathways that leads to endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and platelet activation 11,12. Therefore, in this study, we aim to discover the biochemical and physiological changes induced by medwak smoking and explore the metabolomics profile of medwak smokers with a focus on the markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in comparison to nonsmokers.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001416	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8PM6K			The microbiome-derived metabolite TMAO drives immune activation and boosts response to immune checkpoint blockade in pancreatic cancer	The composition of the gut microbiome controls innate and adaptive immunity and has emerged as a key regulator of tumor growth and the success of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tends to be refractory to therapy, including ICB. We found that the gut microbe-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) enhances anti-tumor immunity to PDAC. Delivery of TMAO given intraperitoneally or via dietary choline supplement to PDAC-bearing mice reduces tumor growth and is associated with an immunostimulatory tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) phenotype and activated effector T cell response in the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, TMAO signals through potentiating type-I interferon (IFN) pathway and confers anti-tumor effects in a type-I IFN dependent manner. Notably, delivering TMAOprimed macrophages alone produced similar anti-tumor effects. Combining TMAO with ICB (anti-PD1 and/or anti-Tim3) significantly reduced tumor burden and improved survival beyond TMAO or ICB alone. Finally, the levels of trimethylamine (TMA)- producing bacteria and of CutC gene expression correlate with improved survivorship and response to anti-PD1 in cancer patients. Together, our study identifies the gut microbial metabolite TMAO as an important driver of anti-tumor immunity and lays the groundwork for new therapeutic strategies.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001417	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8JX39			Spatially resolved characterization of tissue metabolic compartments in fasted and high-fat diet livers	Cells adapt their metabolism to physiological stimuli, and metabolic heterogeneity exists between cell types, within tissues, and subcellular compartments. The liver plays an essential role in maintaining whole-body metabolic homeostasis and is structurally defined by metabolic zones. These zones are well-understood on the transcriptomic level, but have not been comprehensively characterized on the metabolomic level. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) can be used to map hundreds of metabolites directly from a tissue section, offering an important advance to investigate metabolic heterogeneity in tissues compared to extraction-based metabolomics methods that analyze tissue metabolite profiles in bulk. We established a workflow for the preparation of tissue specimens for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MSI that can be implemented to achieve broad coverage of central carbon, nucleotide, and lipid metabolism pathways. Herein, we used this approach to visualize the effect of nutrient stress and excess on liver metabolism. Our data revealed a highly organized metabolic tissue compartmentalization in livers, which becomes disrupted under high fat diet. Fasting caused changes in the abundance of several metabolites, including increased levels of fatty acids and TCA intermediates while fatty livers had higher levels of purine and pentose phosphate-related metabolites, which generate reducing equivalents to counteract oxidative stress. This spatially conserved approach allowed the visualization of liver metabolic compartmentalization at 30 µm pixel resolution and can be applied more broadly to yield new insights into metabolic heterogeneity in vivo.

However, the exact impact of specific metabolic changes on cancer progression is poorly understood. Here, we integrate multimodal analyses of primary and metastatic clonally related clear cell renal cancer cells (ccRCC) grown in physiological media to identify key stage-specific metabolic vulnerabilities. We show that a VHL loss-dependent reprogramming of branched-chain amino acid catabolism sustains the de novo biosynthesis of aspartate and arginine enabling tumor cells with the flexibility of partitioning the nitrogen of the amino acids depending on their needs. Importantly, we identify the epigenetic reactivation of argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1), a urea cycle enzyme suppressed in primary ccRCC, as a crucial event for metastatic renal cancer cells to acquire the capability to generate arginine, invade in vitro and metastasize in vivo. Overall, our study uncovers a novel mechanism of metabolic flexibility occurring during ccRCC progression, paving the way for the development of novel stage-specific therapies.

Methods: H. polygyrus worms were culture for 24h and HDMs were isolated from conditioned media by chromatography. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were treated with HDM for 4 or 20 h. Cells were either stimulated with LPS or adoptively transferred to mice. Cytokine secretion was measured by ELISA. The metabolome of HDM-treated DCs were assessed by mass spectrometry, respectively. Results: Pre-treatment with HDM decreased LPS-induced TNF and increased IL-10 release by BMDCs. Importantly, HDM decreased expression of MHC-II, CD86, and CD40 in BMDCs and splenic DCs, suggesting that HDM induces a tolerogenic profile on DCs. The metabolomic approach revealed a total of 17 downregulated metabolites, against one upregulated of the 225 total peaks analyzed. Functional analyses were performed and results predicted a total of 29 pathways and 43 matched compounds. Scatter plot test of significant peaks revealed two differentially enriched pathways, the sphingolipid metabolism, and a highly enriched pathway, the terpenoid backbone metabolism, witch C00418 metabolite is a potential match to mevalonic acid, according to KEGG compound database in HDM-treated DCs in comparison with naïve DCs. These differentially expressed genes and enriched metabolites may indicate a novel mechanism by which helminths induce a tolerogenic profile in DCs.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001421	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M81X41			De Novo Pyrimidine Synthesis is a Targetable Vulnerability in IDH Mutant Glioma	Mutations affecting isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes are prevalent in glioma, leukemia, and other cancers. Although mutant IDH inhibitors are effective against leukemia, they appear less active in aggressive glioma, underscoring the need for alternative treatment strategies. Through a chemical synthetic lethality screen, we discovered that IDH1 mutant glioma cells are hypersensitive to drugs targeting enzymes in the de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis pathway, including dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). We developed a genetically engineered mouse model of mutant IDH1-driven astrocytoma and used it and multiple patient-derived models to show that the brain-penetrant DHODH inhibitor BAY 2402234 displays monotherapy efficacy against IDH mutant gliomas. Mechanistically, this reflects an obligate dependence of glioma cells on the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway and mutant IDH’s ability to sensitize to DNA damage upon nucleotide pool imbalance. Our work outlines a tumor-selective, biomarker-guided therapeutic strategy that is poised for clinical translation.

Significant challenges still exist in the computational processing of data from LC-MS metabolomic experiments into metabolite features, including provenance and reproducibility of the current software tools. Current dataset, named HZV029, comprises of 268 data files, from two QC (human pooled plasma) samples that were analyzed repeatedly over 17 batches, on a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap ID-X Tribrid mass spectrometer, coupled with dual liquid chromatography via a Transcend LX-2 System. It provides a unique opportunity to be used as a benchmark dataset to evaluate reproducibility via available choices of different processing tools without knowing the ground truth about these QC samples.

While cellular metabolism impacts the DNA damage response, a systematic understanding of the metabolic requirements that are crucial for DNA damage repair has yet to be achieved. Here, we investigate the metabolic enzymes and processes that are essential when cells are exposed to DNA damage. By integrating functional genomics with chromatin proteomics and metabolomics, we provide a detailed description of the interplay between cellular metabolism and the DNA damage response. Subsequent analysis identified Peroxiredoxin 1, PRDX1, as fundamental for DNA damage repair. During the DNA damage response, PRDX1 translocates to the nucleus where it is required to reduce DNA damage-induced nuclear reactive oxygen species levels. Moreover, PRDX1 controls aspartate availability, which is required for the DNA damage repair-induced upregulation of de novo nucleotide synthesis. Loss of PRDX1 leads to an impairment in the clearance of ??2?? nuclear foci, accumulation of replicative stress and cell proliferation defects, thus revealing a crucial role for PRDX1 as a DNA damage surveillance factor.

We previously obtained evidence that a polyamine signature in the blood is associated with TNBC development and progression. In this study, we evaluated whether plasma polyamines and other metabolites may identify TNBC patients who are unlikely to respond to NACT. Pre-treatment plasma levels of acetylated polyamines were elevated in TNBC patients that had moderate to extensive tumor burden (RCB-II/III) following NACT compared to those that achieved a complete pathological response (pCR/RCB-0) or had minimal residual disease (RCB-I). We further applied artificial intelligence to comprehensive metabolic profiles to identify additional metabolites associated with treatment response. A deep learning model (DLM) consisting of two polyamines as well as nine additional metabolites was developed for improved prediction of RCB-II/III. The DLM has potential clinical value for identifying TNBC patients who are unlikely to respond to NACT and who may benefit from other treatment modalities.

Although the survival rate of NB has improved over the years, the outcome of NB still remains unfavorable in a high percentage of cases. Prognosis is currently based on a combination of clinical, histo-pathological and biological features, on which patients are classified in different risk groups and addressed to different treatment protocols. A more accurate risk stratification remains a key point in the study of NB: in particular, the availability of novel prognostic biomarkers of metastatic “high risk” NB at diagnosis could help in improving patient stratification, accurately predicting outcome, relapse or response to treatments and also reducing unnecessary therapies and related toxicities. In this study an HRMS-based approach was applied for the first time to study NB with a goal of developing prognostic biomarkers that could help in improving patient stratification and providing novel therapeutic targets. Starting from an untargeted approach the differences in the metabolomic profiles of localized and metastatic patients were investigated. Key metabolites of metastatic NB were identified through differential expression analysis. Among the metabolites of L-DOPA degradation pathway 3-o-methyldopa (3-O-MD) was selected and analysed in a second cohort of patients using a targeted approach based on liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001429	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M80X3B			Using stable isotopes and mass spectrometry to elucidate the dynamics of metabolic pathways	Data analysis and mass spectrometry tools have advanced significantly in the last decade. This ongoing revolution has elevated the status of analytical chemistry within the big-data omics era. High resolution mass spectrometers (HRMS) can now distinguish different metabolites with mass to charge ratios (i.e. m/z) that differ by 0.01 Da or less. This unprecedented level of resolution not only enables identification of previously unknown compounds but also presents an opportunity to establish active metabolic pathways through quantification of isotope enrichment. Studies with stable isotope tracers continue to contribute to our knowledge of biological pathways in human, plant and bacterial species, however most current studies have been based on targeted analyses. The capacity of HRMS to resolve near-overlapping isotopologues and identify compounds with high mass precision presents a strategy to assess ‘active’ pathways de novo from data generated in an untargeted way, that is blind to the metabolic network and therefore unbiased. Currently, identifying metabolic features, enriched with stable isotopes, at an ‘omics’ level remains an experimental bottleneck, limiting our capacity to understand biological network operation at the metabolic level. We developed data analysis tools that: i) use labeling information and exact mass to determine the elemental composition of each isotopically enriched ion, ii) apply correlation-based approaches to cluster metabolite peaks with similar patterns of isotopic labels and, iii) leverage this information to build directed metabolic networks de novo. Using Camelina sativa, an emerging oilseed model, we demonstrate the power of stable isotope labeling in combination with imaging and HRMS to reconstruct lipid metabolic networks in developing seeds and are currently addressing questions about lipid and central metabolism. Tools developed in this study will have a broader application to assess context specific operation of metabolic pathways.

Acetate metabolism may contribute to this axis by ACSS2-dependent acetylation of HIF-2a and may provide opportunities to intervention. Here we tested the effects of pharmacological and genetic manipulation of ACSS2 on HIF-2a, ccRCC cells, and tumors. ACSS2 inhibition led to HIF-2a degradation and suppressed ccRCC growth in vitro, in vivo, and in primary cell cultures of ccRCC patient tumors. This treatment resulted in reduced glucose and cholesterol metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis and altered cristae deformation, that are consistent with loss of HIF-2a. Mechanistically, HIF-2a protein levels are regulated through proteolytic degradation and we found, in parallel to VHL, HIF-2a stability was dependent on ACSS2 activity to prevent direct interaction with the E3 ligase MUL1. These findings highlight ACSS2 as a critical upstream regulator of pathogenically stabilized HIF-2a, and provides a mechanism that may be exploited to overcome resistance to HIF-2a inhibitor therapies.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001431	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8RD8W			Hypoxia promotes osteogenesis via regulating the acetyl-CoA-mediated mito-nuclear communication.	Bone-mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reside in a hypoxic niche that maintains their differentiation potential. Although the role of hypoxia (low oxygen concentration) in the regulation of stem cell function has been previously reported, with normoxia (high oxygen concentration) leading to impaired osteogenesis, the molecular events triggering changes in stem cell fate decisions in response to high oxygen remain elusive. Here, we study the impact of normoxia on the mito-nuclear communication with regards to stem cell differentiation. We show that normoxia-cultured MSCs undergo profound transcriptional alterations which cause irreversible osteogenesis defects. Mechanistically, high oxygen promotes chromatin compaction and histone hypo-acetylation, particularly on promoters and enhancers of osteogenic genes. Although normoxia induces metabolic rewiring resulting in high acetyl-CoA levels, histone hypo-acetylation occurs due to trapping of acetyl-CoA inside mitochondria, owing to lower CiC activity. Strikingly, restoring the cytosolic acetyl-CoA pool remodels the chromatin landscape and rescues the osteogenic defects. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the metabolism-chromatin-osteogenesis axis is heavily perturbed in response to high oxygen and identify CiC as a novel, oxygen-sensitive regulator of the MSC function.

The use of nanoparticles (NPs) as carriers for chemotherapeutic agents has considerably increased the therapeutic effect of those drugs by improving their bioavailability and altering their bio-distribution profile. Untargeted metabolomics has emerged as potential approach to understand better tumor progression and treatment outcome of multiple cancer cell types. Herein, we have employed LCMS/MS based untargeted metabolomics to pinpoint differences in metabolic profile of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas FaDu, when treated with anticancer Paclitaxel (PTX) delivered as free drugversus Paclitaxel-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticle (PXT-PLGA-NPs). The experimental design include four groups treated with DMSO (control), treated with drug free PXT, PXT-PLGA-NPs and PLGA-NPs without PXT. Data was analyzed using MetaboScape (V4, Bruker Daltonics) platform and matched to Bruker Human Metabolome Data Base (HMDB) spectral library 2.0. We identified and total of 162 high confident assigned metabolites. Principle component analysis of the metabolites revealed that PTX free drug clustered together with PXT-PLGA-NPs, whereas control and PLGA-NPs without PXT clustered away from drug treated cells but apart from each other (see figure below). Further group pairwise comparisons indicated 37 metabolites significantly (p<0.05) dysregulated between PTX free drug and PXT-PLGA-NPs. Of these, it is worthy highlight metabolites that became more abundant with PXT-PLGA-NPs treatment, such as 5-Thymidyclic acid 7. 8 fold change (FC) and 3,4,5-Trimethoxycinnamic acid that have been associated previously associated with effective anticancer drug treatment (Quinn et al. 2015; Anantharaju et al. 2017). The results are in line with our pervious findings supporting a more effective antidrug treatment using NP and we indicate a number of metabolites that are potential markers for monitoring the efficacy antidrug treatment.

The current work was designed to investigate the metabolomics changes incurred upon the observance of Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF). Twenty-five metabolically healthy participants with overweight and obesity (7 females and 18 males, with a mean age of 39.48±10.0 years) were recruited for the study and were followed before and at the end of RDIF month. Dietary, anthropometric, biochemical, and physical activity assessments were performed before and at the end of the fasting month. The metabolomic assay was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for the two-time points. Metabolomics assay revealed a significant reduction in a few metabolites. The analysis revealed that 27 metabolites differed significantly (P<0.05) between pre-and post-RDIF. Among the differentially abundant metabolites, 23 showed a decrease with fasting, these included several amino acids such as aspartame, tryptophan, phenylalanine, histidine, and other metabolites including valeric acid, and cortisol. On the other hand, only four metabolites showed increased levels with RDIF including traumatic acid, 2-pyrrolidinone, PC(18:1(9Z)/18:1(9Z)), and L-sorbose. The MetaboAnalyst® platform reported that the top enriched metabolic pathways included: (1) histidine metabolism; (2) folate biosynthesis (3) phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis; (3) aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; (3) caffeine metabolism (4) vitamin B6 metabolism; and several other pathways relating to lipid metabolisms such as arachidonic acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and linoleic acid metabolism. In conclusion, RDIF entails significant changes in various metabolic pathways that reflect different dietary and lifestyle behaviors practiced during the fasting month.

After ingesting raw meat containing infective larvae of Trichinella spp., patients may show signs of myalgia, headaches, facial and periorbital edema. In severe cases, patients develop myocarditis, heart failure, and possibly death. The standard method for diagnosis of Trichinella infection is immunological techniques, which lack of sensitivity and timeliness. Metabolomics has been extensively used to identify compounds with diagnostic potential in many diseases, however, there is no study regarding biomarker discovery in trichinellosis yet. Therefore, this study aims to identify potential biomarkers of trichinellosis using metabolomics. Mice were infected with larvae stage of T. spiralis and their serum were collected before, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after infection. Metabolites in serum were extracted and identified using mass spectrometer in untargeted manner. Metabolomic data was annotated with XCMS online platform and analyzed with Metaboanalyst version 5.0. A total of 4,688 and 5,533 metabolite features were identified from positive and negative mode, respectively. The 1,139 features were significantly changed metabolites and further used for pathway analysis and biomarker selection. Glycerophospholipid metabolism was the major pathway affected by Trichinella infection and these lipid species were the main lipid class identified. The Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) revealed 247 molecules with diagnostic power of trichinellosis. Phosphatidylserine was the major lipid class from ROC analysis, for example, PS(12:0/15:0), PS(18:0/19:0)[U]. Our study suggested glycerophospholipid and phosphatidylserine species as the potential markers of trichinellosis. Findings of this study are the initial step for biomarker discovery in trichinellosis, which would be a benefit for improvement of disease diagnosis in the future.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain not fully understood. Using a well-established baboon model of MO, we analyzed tissue biopsies and plasma samples obtained from post-pubertal offspring (3-6.5y at sample collection) of MO mothers (n=19) and from control animals born to mothers fed a standard diet (CON, n=13). All offspring ate normal chow diet after weaning. With an untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics profiling, we quantified a total of 351 liver, 316 skeletal muscle and 423 plasma metabolites. We found 58 metabolites significantly altered in liver and 46 in skeletal muscle of MO offspring, including 8 metabolites shared between both tissues. Male and female-specific metabolites in opposite direction of change were found in liver and skeletal muscle of MO offspring. Several tissue-specific and 4 shared metabolic pathways were identified from these dysregulated metabolites. Interestingly, none of the tissue-specific metabolic alterations reflected in plasma. Our results identify tissue metabolites and pathways in post-pubertal MO offspring in a sex-specific manner.

It is unknown how dietary change influences liver homeostasis. Here, we show that a switch from ad libitum feeding to intermittent fasting (IF) promotes rapid hepatocyte proliferation. Mechanistically, IF- induced hepatocyte proliferation is driven by the combined action of intestinally produced, systemic endocrine FGF15 and localized WNT signaling. IF proliferation re-establishes a constant liver-to-body-mass ratio during periods of fasting and re-feeding, a process termed the hepatostat. This study provides the first example of dietary influence on adult hepatocyte proliferation, and challenges the widely held view that liver tissue is mostly quiescent unless chemically or mechanically injured.

NMR analysis alone revealed no significant differences between the dental erosion and healthy controls. However, bacterial mRNA sequencing of the oral microbiome from the same saliva samples was performed and the bacterial gene expression profiles was correlated to metabolite concentrations in the groups.

Whereas in the healthy control group, the only positive correlations between metabolite concentrations and bacterial activity was for urea and 5-aminopentanoate; urea was positively correlated with Aggregatibacter actinomycetecomytans, Lysinibacillus fusiformis, and Veillonella tobetsuensis, and 5-aminopentanoate was positively correlated with 3 different Leptotrichia species, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and 2 Prevotella species.

The lava-impacted seawater was characterized by high concentrations of metals and nutrients that stimulated phytoplankton growth, resulting in an extensive plume of chlorophyll a that was detectable by satellite. Samples for particulate metabolites were collected from different stations surrounding the lava flowing into the ocean to see how marine microorganisms respond to exogenous inputs of nutrients and metals.

To do so, differently sized Ch-Ge films (25 and 100 cm2) were tested, as well as SO2-tretment and untreated wines. The obtained data added important knowledge on the potential use of Ch-Ge films, particularly those of higher surface areas, as replacements for the use of SO2 in wine conservation, based on the changes noted in metabolite composition and their putative explanations in terms of wine chemical and biochemical characteristics.

Pathological reduction of ATs in lipodystrophy leads to an array of metabolic diseases. Understanding the underlying mechanisms may benefit the development of effective therapies. Several cellular processes, including autophagy, function collectively to maintain AT homeostasis. Here, we investigated the impact of adipocyte-specific deletion of the autophagy-related lipid kinase PIK3C3 on AT homeostasis and systemic metabolism in mice. We report that PIK3C3 functions in all ATs and that its absence disturbs adipocyte autophagy and hinders adipocyte differentiation, survival, and function with differential effects on brown and white ATs. These abnormalities caused loss of white ATs, whitening followed by loss of brown ATs, and impaired browning of white ATs. Consequently, mice exhibited compromised thermogenic capacity and developed dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. While these effects of PIK3C3 contrast previous findings with the autophagy-related protein ATG7 in adipocytes, mice with a combined deficiency in both factors revealed a dominant role of the PIK3C3-deficient phenotype. We also found that dietary lipid excess exacerbates AT pathologies caused by PIK3C3 deficiency. Surprisingly, glucose tolerance was spared in adipocyte-specific PIK3C3-deficient mice, a phenotype that was more evident during dietary lipid excess. These findings reveal a crucial yet complex role for PIK3C3 in ATs and suggest the potential of targeting this factor for therapeutic intervention in metabolic diseases.

However, the histological features of children are different from those of adults, and the onset and progression of pediatric NAFLD are not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the metabolome profile and metabolic pathway changes associated with pediatric NAFLD to elucidate its pathophysiology. We analyzed the metabolic profiles of healthy control, lean NAFLD, overweight control and overweight NAFLD groups of children and adolescent participants (n = 165) by assessing plasma samples, and identified 18 NAFLD-specific metabolic features and metabolic changes in lipid, glutathione-related amino acid, and branched-chain amino acid metabolism by comparing control and NAFLD group in pediatric population with overweight. Metabolome changes in the plasma of pediatric patients with NAFLD are associated with the pathophysiology of the disease and can be utilized as a less-invasive approach to diagnose the disease.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001453	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8X13R			Germination physiology	Seeds are the major component of feed and food and the majority of crops are produced from seeds. This means that as the world population increases so does the demand for seed. Sub-optimal seed performance can lead to major economic losses and food supply shortages and this is set to be aggravated by climate change as abiotic constraints negatively impact seed quality. Our aim is to decrypt the central mechanisms that mediate germination while exploring their potential in applications to enhance seed performance. In particular, we seek to understand how seeds interpret and respond to environmental variations pre- and post-harvest. We apply a multidisciplinary approach using molecular genetics, multi-omics, statistical learning, bioinformatics, biochemistry, histology and physiology to study seeds from a wide range of species such as oilseed crops (e.g. camelina, cabbage), legumes (e.g. bean, lentil), cereals (e.g barley, maize) and vegetable crops (e.g. tomato and lettuce). Nonetheless, the majority of our fundamental research focuses on the genetic model Arabidopsis.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001454	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8S71T			Multi-Omics analysis revealed a significant alteration of critical metabolic pathways due to sorafenib-resistance in Hep3B cell lines	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second prominent cause of cancer-associated death worldwide. Usually, HCC is diagnosed in advanced stages, where sorafenib, a multiple target ty-rosine kinase inhibitor, is used as the first line of treatment. Unfortunately, resistance to sorafenib is usually encountered within six months of the treatment. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify the underlying reasons for drug resistance. In the present study, we investigated the proteomic and metabolomics alterations accompanying to sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells by employing ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS). The Bruker Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) library was used to identify the differentially abundant metabolites through MetaboScape 4.0 software (Bruker). For protein annotation and identification, the Uniprot proteome for Homo sapiens (Human) da-tabase was utilised through MaxQuant. The results revealed that 27 metabolites and 18 proteins were significantly dysregulated due to sorafenib resistance in Hep3B cells compared to the parental phenotype. D-alanine, L-proline, o-tyrosine, succinic acid and phosphatidylcholine (PC, 16:0/16:0) were among the significantly altered metabolites. Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, UDP-glucose-6-dehydrogenase, sorbitol dehydrogenase and calpain small subunit 1 were among the significantly altered proteins. The findings revealed that resistant Hep3B cells demonstrated significant alterations in amino acid and nucleotide met-abolic pathways, energy production pathways and other pathways related to cancer aggressive-ness, migration, proliferation, and drug-resistance. Joint pathway enrichment analysis unveiled unique pathways, including the antifolate resistance pathway and other important pathways that maintain cancer cells' survival, growth, and proliferation. Collectively, the results identified po-tential biomarkers for sorafenib-resistant HCC and gave insights into their role in chemotherapeutic drug resistance, cancer initiation, progression, and aggressiveness, which may contribute to better prognosis and chemotherapeutic outcomes.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001455	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8NH7M			1-deoxysphingolipid synthesis compromises anchorage-independent growth and plasma membrane endocytosis in cancer cells	Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) predominantly incorporates serine and fatty acyl-CoAs into diverse sphingolipids that serve as structural components of membranes and signaling molecules within or amongst cells. However, SPT also uses alanine as a substrate in the contexts of low serine availability, alanine accumulation, or disease-causing mutations in hereditary sensory neuropathy type I (HSAN1), resulting in the synthesis and accumulation of 1-deoxysphingolipids. These species promote cytotoxicity in neurons and impact diverse cellular phenotypes, including suppression of anchorage-independent cancer cell growth. While altered serine and alanine can promote 1-deoxysphingolipid synthesis, they impact numerous other metabolic pathways important for cancer cells. Here we combined isotope tracing, quantitative metabolomics, and functional studies to better understand the mechanistic drivers of 1-deoxysphingolipid toxicity in cancer cells. Both alanine treatment and SPTLC1C133W expression induce 1-deoxy(dihydro)ceramide synthesis and accumulation but fail to broadly impact intermediary metabolism, abundances of other lipids, or growth of adherent cells. However, spheroid culture and soft agar colony formation were compromised when endogenous 1-deoxysphingolipid synthesis was induced via SPTLC1C133W expression. Consistent with these impacts on anchorage-independent cell growth, we observed that 1-deoxysphingolipid synthesis reduced plasma membrane endocytosis. These results highlight a potential role for SPT promiscuity in linking altered amino acid metabolism to plasma membrane endocytosis.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001457	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8D133			Machine Learning Reveals Lipidome Dynamics in a Mouse Model of Ovarian Cancer	Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the deadliest cancers affecting the female reproductive system. It presents little or no symptoms at the early stages, and typically unspecific symptoms at later stages. Of the OC subtypes, high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is responsible for most OC deaths. However, very little is known about the metabolic course of this disease. In this longitudinal study, we investigated the temporal course of lipidome changes in a Dicer-Pten Double-Knockout (DKO) HGSC mouse model using machine and statistical learning approaches. Early progression of HGSC was marked by increased levels of phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines. In contrast, later stages were marked by more diverse lipids alterations, including fatty acids and their derivatives, triglycerides, ceramides, hexosylceramides, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines, and phosphatidylinositols. These alterations provided evidence of perturbations in cell membrane stability, proliferation, and survival and candidates for early-stage and prognostic markers in humans.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001458	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8898H			Skin-to-blood pH shift triggers metabolome and proteome global remodelling in Staphylococcus epidermidis	Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) is one of the most common bacteria of the human skin microbiota. Despite its role as a commensal, SE has emerged as an opportunistic pathogen, associated with 80% of medical devices related infections. Moreover, these bacteria are extremely difficult to treat due to their ability to form biofilms and accumulate resistance to almost all classes of antimicrobials developed so far. Thus new preventive and therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. In spite of its clinical importance, the molecular mechanisms associated with SE colonisation and disease are still poorly understood. A deeper understanding of the metabolic and cellular processes associated with response to environmental factors characteristic of SE ecological niches in health and disease might provide new clues on colonisation and disease processes. Here we studied the impact of pH conditions, mimicking the skin pH (5.5) and blood pH (7.4), in a S. epidermidis commensal strain, belonging to the B clonal lineage, by means of next-generation proteomics and 1H NMR-based metabolomics. Moreover, we evaluated the metabolic changes occurring when a sudden pH change arise, simulating the skin barrier break produced by a catheter. We found that exposure of S. epidermidis to skin pH induced oxidative phosphorylation and biosynthesis of peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acids and betaine. In contrast, at blood pH, the incorporation of monosaccharides and its oxidation by glycolysis and fermentation was promoted. Additionally, several proteins related to virulence and immune evasion, namely extracellular proteases and membrane iron transporters were more abundant at blood pH. In the situation of an abrupt skin-to-blood pH shift we observed the decrease in the osmolyte betaine and changes in the levels of several metabolites and proteins involved in redox cell homeostasis. Our results suggest that at the skin pH S. epidermidis cells are metabolically more active and adhesion is promoted, while at blood pH, metabolism is tuned down and cells have a more virulent profile. pH increase during commensal-to-pathogen conversion appears to be a critical environmental signal to the remodelling of the S. epidermidis metabolism towards a more pathogenic state. Targeting S. epidermidis proteins induced by a low alkaline pH and local acidification of medical devices microenvironment might be new strategies to treat and prevent S. epidermidis infections.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001460	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M80T4P			Oxidative phosphorylation selectively orchestrates tissue macrophage homeostasis	In vitro studies associated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) with anti-inflammatory macrophages, while pro-inflammatory macrophages rely on glycolysis. However, the metabolic needs of macrophages in tissues (TMFs) to fulfil their homeostatic activities are incompletely understood. Here, we identified OXPHOS as highly discriminating process among TMFs from different tissues in homeostasis by analysis of RNAseq data, in both human and mouse. Impairing OXPHOS in TMFs via Tfam deletion differentially affected TMF populations. Tfam deletion resulted in reduction of alveolar macrophages (AMs) due to impaired lipid-handling capacity, leading to increased cholesterol content and cellular stress, causing cell cycle arrest in vivo. In obesity, Tfam depletion selectively ablated pro-inflammatory lipid-handling white adipose tissue macrophages (WAT-MFs), preventing insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis. Thus, OXPHOS, rather than glycolysis, distinguishes TMF populations and is critical for the maintenance of TMFs with a high lipid-handling activity, including pro-inflammatory WAT-MFs. This could provide a selective therapeutic targeting tool.

The preferred lifestyle of soil microbes is in the form of biofilms. However, little is known about whether root VOCs (rVOCs) can influence soil biofilms beyond the 2-10 mm rhizosphere zone influenced by soluble root exudates. Here, we report that rVOCs shift the microbiome composition and growth dynamics of complex soil biofilms. This signaling is evolutionarily conserved from ferns to higher plants, which suggests its coevolution. The defense phytohormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is present in rVOCs and drives this bioactivity at nanomolar levels within a few hours.

In that sense, a complete understanding of Leishmania biology and host-pathogen interactions is mandatory to fully recognize the molecular and cellular foundations of leishmaniasis pathogenesis. Recent studies have been demonstrating how innate cell metabolism associates to the development of resistance towards infection. As the causality in the immunometabolic connections remains untested, we propose to employ an integrative approach aiming at mapping the Leishmania-induced shifts in metabolic networks in macrophages and neutrophils, deciphering the molecular mechanisms of the metabolic shifts and establishing its causal relationship with the anti-leishmanial immune response mediated by these two types of cells. Dissecting these aspects is critical not only for an in-depth understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying Leishmania pathogenesis, but also to drive significant advances in the development of novel diagnostic and immunotherapeutic approaches.

Moreover, factors that drive recovery from COVID-19 can be explored to identify correlates of protection. The cellular metabolism represents a potential target to improve survival upon severe disease, but the associations between the metabolism and the inflammatory response during COVID-19 are not well defined. We analyzed blood laboratorial parameters, cytokines, and metabolomes of 150 individuals with mild to severe disease, of which 33 progressed to a fatal outcome. A subset of 20 individuals was followed-up after hospital discharge and recovery of acute disease. We used hierarchical community networks to integrate metabolomics profiles with cytokines and markers of inflammation, coagulation, and tissue damage. Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) promotes significant alterations in the plasma metabolome, whose activity varies according to disease severity and correlates with oxygen saturation. Differential metabolism underlying death was marked by amino acids and related metabolites, such as glutamate, tryptophan and oxoproline; and lipids, including progesterone, phosphocholine and lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPCs). Individuals that recovered from severe disease displayed persistent alterations enriched for metabolism of purines, phosphatidylinositol phosphate and glycolysis. Recovery of mild disease was associated with vitamin E metabolism. Data integration shows that the metabolic response is a hub connecting other biological features during disease and recovery. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 induces concerted activity of metabolic and inflammatory responses that depend on disease severity and collectively predict clinical outcomes of COVID-19.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001470	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8Q99X			Quantification of Dissolved Metabolites in Environmental Samples through Cation-Exchange Solid Phase Extraction (CX-SPE) paired with Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry	Small, biologically produced, organic molecules called metabolites play key roles in microbial systems where they directly mediate exchanges of nutrients, energy, and information. However, the study of dissolved polar metabolites in seawater and other environmental matrices has been hampered by analytical challenges including high inorganic ion concentrations, low analyte concentrations, and high chemical diversity. Here we show that a cation-exchange solid phase extraction (CX-SPE) sample preparation approach separates positively charged and zwitterionic metabolites from seawater and freshwater samples, allowing their analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We successfully extracted 69 known compounds from an in-house compound collection and evaluated the performance of the method by establishing extraction efficiencies and limits of detection (pM to low nM range) for these compounds. CX-SPE extracted a range of compounds including amino acids and compatible solutes, resulted in very low matrix effects, and performed robustly across large variations in salinity and dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration. We compared CX-SPE to an established solid phase extraction procedure (PPL-SPE) and demonstrate that these two methods extract fundamentally different fractions of the dissolved metabolite pool with CX-SPE extracting compounds that are on average smaller and more polar. We use CX-SPE to analyze four environmental samples from distinct aquatic biomes, producing some of the first CX-SPE dissolved metabolomes. Quantified compounds ranged in concentration from 0.0093 nM to 49 nM and were composed primarily of amino acids (0.15 – 16 nM) and compatible solutes such as TMAO (0.89 – 49 nM) and glycine betaine (2.8 – 5.2 nM).
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001471	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8KH70			Metabolomic analysis in SONIA 2, a phase 3 international randomised-controlled trial of nitisinone in alkaptonuria (AKU)	Abstract from main SONIA 2 publication: Background Alkaptonuria is a rare, genetic, multisystem disease characterised by the accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA). No HGA-lowering therapy has been approved to date. The aim of SONIA 2 was to investigate the efficacy and safety of once-daily nitisinone for reducing HGA excretion in patients with alkaptonuria and to evaluate whether nitisinone has a clinical benefit. Methods SONIA 2 was a 4-year, open-label, evaluator-blind, randomised, no treatment controlled, parallel-group study done at three sites in the UK, France, and Slovakia. Patients aged 25 years or older with confirmed alkaptonuria and any clinical disease manifestations were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral nitisinone 10 mg daily or no treatment. Patients could not be masked to treatment due to colour changes in the urine, but the study was evaluator-blinded as far as possible. The primary endpoint was daily urinary HGA excretion (u-HGA24) after 12 months. Clinical evaluation Alkaptonuria Severity Score Index (cAKUSSI) score was assessed at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. Efficacy variables were analysed in all randomly assigned patients with a valid u-HGA24 measurement at baseline. Safety variables were analysed in all randomly assigned patients. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01916382). Findings Between May 7, 2014, and Feb 16, 2015, 139 patients were screened, of whom 138 were included in the study, with 69 patients randomly assigned to each group. 55 patients in the nitisinone group and 53 in the control group completed the study. u-HGA24 at 12 months was significantly decreased by 99·7% in the nitisinone group compared with the control group (adjusted geometric mean ratio of nitisinone/control 0·003 [95% CI 0·003 to 0·004], p<0·0001). At 48 months, the increase in cAKUSSI score from baseline was significantly lower in the nitisinone group compared with the control group (adjusted mean difference –8·6 points [–16·0 to –1·2], p=0·023). 400 adverse events occurred in 59 (86%) patients in the nitisinone group and 284 events occurred in 57 (83%) patients in the control group. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Interpretation Nitisinone 10 mg daily was well tolerated and effective in reducing urinary excretion of HGA. Nitisinone decreased ochronosis and improved clinical signs, indicating a slower disease progression.

Nevertheless, little is known about the biochemical events that cause depression due to stress. Our study employed open field test, plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone determination, serum biochemical analysis, quantitative PCR, immunoblotting, enzyme activity assay, and NMR-based metabolomics to analyze and identify the biochemical variations of body fluids (serum and urine) and tissues (brain, kidney, liver, lung, and spleen) in an acute restraint stress-induced rat model of depression. Our data suggested that the post-stress effects on biochemical alterations involved different biochemical pathways, including regulating the NAD(P) pool, glucose homeostasis, biosynthesis and degradation of heme, and uric acid production and metabolism. The urinary excretion of nicotinate and nicotinamide N-oxide increased significantly. Thus, we conclude that the depletion of NAD(P) precursors may occur in response to restraint stress. Our results show a close association between NAD(P) deficiency and post-stress metabolic dysfunction, which would provide a ground for developing recovery-promoting micronutrients in treating depression.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001474	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M86998			Serum metabolomics profiling identifies new predictive biomarkers for disease severity in COVID-19 patients	Over the last three years, numerous groups have reported on different predictive models of disease severity in COVID-19 patients. However, almost all such models, which relied on serum biomarkers, clinical data or a combination of both, were subsequently deemed as cumbersome, inadequate and/or subject to bias. Moreover, although serum metabolomics profiling has shown significant differences among patients with different degrees of disease severity, the use of serum metabolomics profiling to identify prognostic biomarkers has, so far, been neglected. Herein, we sought to develop highly predictive models of disease severity by integrating routine laboratory findings and serum metabolomics profiling which identified several metabolites including K_4_aminophenol, acetaminophen and cytosine as potential biomarkers of disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Two models were subsequently developed and internally validated on the basis of ROC-AUC values. The predictive accuracy of the first model was 0.998 (95% CI: 0.992 to 1.000) with an optimal cut-off risk score of 4 biomarkers from among 8 linearly-related biomarkers (D-dimer, ferritin, neutrophil counts, Hp, sTfR, K_4_aminophenol, acetaminophen and cytosine). The predictive accuracy of the second model was 0.996 (95% CI: 0.989 to 1.000) with an optimal cut-off risk score of 3 biomarkers from among 6 biomarkers (D-dimer, ferritin, neutrophil counts, Hp, sTfR and cytosine). The two models are of high predictive power, need a small number of variables that can be acquired at minimal cost and effort, and can be applied independent of non-empirical clinical data. In conclusion, the metabolomics profiling data and the modeling work stemming from it, as presented here, could further explain the cause of COVID-19 disease prognosis and patient management.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001475	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M82M60			Integrated metabolomics and lipidomics study of patients with atopic dermatitis in response to dupilumab	Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases. Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 receptors, has been widely used in AD because of its efficacy. However, metabolic changes occurring in patients with AD in response to dupilumab remains unknown. In this study, we integrated metabolomics and lipidomics analyses with clinical data to explore potential metabolic alterations associated with dupilumab therapeutic efficacy. In addition, we investigate whether the development of treatment side effects was linked to the dysregulation of metabolic pathways. Methods: A total of 33 patients with AD were included in the current study, with serum samples collected before and after treatment with dupilumab. Comprehensive metabolomic and lipidomic analyses have previously been developed to identify serum metabolites (including lipids) that vary among treatment groups. An orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis model was established to screen for differential metabolites and metabolites with variable importance in projection > 1 and p < 0.05 were considered potential metabolic biomarkers. MetaboAnalyst 5.0 was used to identify related metabolic pathways. Patients were further classified into two groups, well responders (n = 19) and poor responders (n = 14), to identify differential metabolites between the two groups. Results: The results revealed significant changes in serum metabolites before and after 16 weeks of dupilumab treatment. Variations in the metabolic profile were more significant in the well-responder group than in the poor-responder group. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that differential metabolites derived from the well-responder group were mainly involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, the citrate cycle, arachidonic acid metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and sphingolipid metabolism. Conclusion: Serum metabolic profiles of patients with AD varied significantly after treatment with dupilumab. Differential metabolites and their related metabolic pathways may provide clues for understanding the effects of dupilumab on patient metabolism.

The gene encoding FIT2 is essential for the viability of mice and worms. Whether FIT2 acts as an acyl-CoA diphosphatase in vivo and how this activity affects liver, where the protein was discovered, are unknown. Here, we report that hepatocyte-specific Fitm2 knockout (FIT2-LKO) mice fed a chow diet exhibited elevated acyl-CoA levels, ER stress, and signs of liver injury. These mice also had more triglycerides in their livers than control littermates due, in part, to impaired secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and reduced capacity for fatty acid oxidation. Challenging FIT2-LKO mice with a high-fat diet worsened hepatic ER stress and liver injury, but unexpectedly reversed the steatosis phenotype, similar to what is observed in FIT2-deficient cells loaded with fatty acids. Our findings support the model that FIT2 acts as an acyl-CoA diphosphatase in vivo and is crucial for normal hepatocyte function and ER homeostasis in murine liver.

WNS-positive little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) can exhibit an immune response during infection that include increases in cytokine and pro-inflammatory mediator gene levels. While bioactive lipid mediators (oxylipins) formed by enzymatic oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can contribute to this type of immune response, their role in WNS pathophysiology have not been investigated. Nonenzymatic conversion of PUFAs can also occur due to reactive oxygen species (ROS), however, these enantiomeric isomers will lack the same signaling properties. In this study, we performed a series of targeted lipidomic approaches on laboratory Pd-inoculated bats to assess changes in their splenic lipidome, including the formation of lipid mediators at early stages of WNS. Hepatic lipids previously identified were also resolved to a higher structural detail. We compared WNS-susceptible M. lucifugus to a WNS-resistant species, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus). Altered splenic lipid levels were only observed in M. lucifugus, with lower total levels of glycerophospholipids (GPs) and free fatty acids (FFAs) in the Pd-inoculated group compared to the sham-inoculated group. Lower concentrations of splenic GPs were observed in lipid compounds containing 18:2 or saturated acyl chains. Differences in splenic FFAs included both omega-3 (including docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and omega-6 compounds. Increased levels of an enantiomeric monohydroxy DHA (4-hydroxydocosahexaenoic [HDoHE], 10-HDoHE, and 13-HDoHE) mixture, suggesting nonenzymatic formation, along with 6-keto-PGF1a were found. Changes in previously identified hepatic lipids were confined to omega-3 constituents. Together, these results suggest that increased oxidative stress, but not an inflammatory response, is occurring in bats at early stages of WNS that proceeds fat depletion.

It plays a significant role in the innate immune recognition of bacteria and response to exogenous molecules in the human host. By stimulating host immune cells with microbiota metabolites, the AhR signaling enables microbiota-dependent induction, training, and function of the host immune system. AhR is a potential target for developing therapeutics to treat myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), cancer, and aging-related diseases. A variety of bioactive molecules can act as AhR agonists, including the metabolites and derivatives of indole and tryptophan. However, given the ligand-binding versatility of AhR, new methods are needed to discover novel AhR agonists. Herein, we report an analytical workflow for the deep discovery of AhR agonists from the secreted metabolome of bacteria. It is efficient to involve the activity measurement in the early stages of discovering new AhR ligands. Moreover, utilization of the AhR-chaperone complex in live cells by the AhR activity assay can mitigate the need for purifying the complex and allows for the deep discovery of low-concentration activators.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001480	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8DT4D			Targeting malaria parasites with novel derivatives of azithromycin	The spread of artemisinin resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites is of global concern and highlights the need to identify new antimalarials for future treatments. Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic used clinically against malaria, kills parasites via two mechanisms: ‘delayed death’ by inhibiting the bacterium-like ribosomes of the apicoplast, and ‘quick-killing’ that kills rapidly across the entire blood stage development. Here, 22 azithromycin analogues were explored for delayed death and quick-killing activities against P. falciparum (the most virulent human malaria) and P. knowlesi (a monkey parasite that frequently infects humans). Seventeen analogues showed improved quick-killing against both Plasmodium species, with up to 38 to 20-fold higher potency over azithromycin after less than 48 or 28 hours of treatment for P. falciparum and P. knowlesi, respectively. Lead analogues had limited activity against the related parasite Toxoplasma gondii and were >5-fold more selective against malaria than human cells. Quick-killing analogues maintained activity throughout the blood stage lifecycle including ring stages of P. falciparum parasites (<12 hrs treatment). Isopentenyl pyrophosphate supplemented parasites that lacked an apicoplast were equally sensitive to quick-killing analogues, confirming that the quick killing activity of these drugs was not directed at the apicoplast. Metabolomic profiling of parasites subjected to the lead analogue revealed a similar profile to chloroquine treatment, suggesting that the food-vacuole is a likely target of this drugs activity. The azithromycin analogues characterised in this study expanded the structural diversity over previously reported quick-killing compounds and provide new starting points to develop azithromycin analogues with quick-killing antimalarial activity.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001484	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8WT54			Differential requirements for mitochondrial electron transport chain components in the adult murine liver	Mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) dysfunction due to mutations in the nuclear or mitochondrial genome is a common cause of metabolic disease in humans, and displays striking tissue specificity depending on the affected gene. The mechanisms underlying tissue specific phenotypes are not understood. Complex I (cI) is classically considered the entry point for electrons into the ETC, and in vitro experiments indicate that cI is required for basal respiration and maintenance of the NAD+/NADH ratio, an indicator of cellular redox status. This finding has largely not been tested in vivo. Here, we report that mitochondrial complex I (cI) is dispensable for homeostasis of the adult mouse liver; animals with hepatocyte-specific loss of cI function display no overt phenotypes or signs of liver damage, and maintain liver function, redox and oxygen status. Further analysis of cI-deficient livers did not reveal significant proteomic or metabolic changes, indicating little to no compensation is required in the setting of complex I loss. In contrast, complex IV (cIV) dysfunction in adult hepatocytes results in decreased liver function, impaired oxygen handling, steatosis, and liver damage, accompanied by significant metabolomic and proteomic perturbations. Metabolomic analysis suggests that the electron transfer flavoprotein complex constitutes a major route for electron entry into the hepatic ETC. Our results support a model whereby complex I loss is tolerated in the mouse liver because hepatocytes use alternative electron donors to fuel the mitochondrial ETC.

We explored the effect of the anticancer drugs tamoxifen and trastuzumab, both separately and in combination, on the integrated proteomic and metabolic profile of triple positive breast cancer cells (BT-474). Method We employed ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry using a Bruker timsTOF to investigate changes in BT-474 cell line treated with either tamoxifen, trastuzumab or a combination. Differentially abundant metabolites were identified using the Bruker Human Metabolome Database metabolite library and proteins using the Uniprot proteome for Homo sapiens using MetaboScape and MaxQuant, respectively, for identification and quantitation. Results A total of 77 proteins and 85 metabolites were found to significantly differ in abundance in BT-474 treated cells with tamoxifen 5 µM/and or trastuzumab 2.5 µM. Findings suggest that by targeting important cellular signalling pathways which regulate cell growth, apoptosis, proliferation, and chemoresistance, these medicines have a considerable anti-growth effect in BT-474 cells. Pathways enriched for dysregulation include RNA splicing, neutrophil degranulation and activation, cellular redox homeostasis, mitochondrial transmembrane transport, ferroptosis and necroptosis, ABC transporters and central carbon metabolism. Conclusion Our findings in protein and metabolite level research revealed that anti-cancer drug therapy had a significant impact on the key signalling pathways and molecular processes in triple positive BT-474 cell lines.

However, studies of the metabolome have so far focused predominantly on urban, industrialized populations. Through an untargeted metabolomic analysis of 90 fecal samples from human individuals from Africa and the Americas—the birthplace and the last continental expansion of our species, respectively—we characterized a shared human fecal metabolome. The majority of detected metabolite features were ubiquitous across populations, despite any geographic, dietary, or behavioral differences. Such shared metabolite features included hyocholic acid and cholesterol. However, any characterization of the shared human fecal metabolome is insufficient without exploring the influence of industrialization. Here, we show chemical differences along an industrialization gradient, where the degree of industrialization correlates with metabolomic changes. We identified differential metabolite features like amino acid-conjugated bile acids and urobilin as major metabolic correlates of these behavioral shifts. Additionally, co-analyses with over 5,000 publicly available human fecal samples and co-occurrence probability analyses with the gut microbiome highlight connections between the human fecal metabolome and gut microbiome. Our results indicate that industrialization significantly influences the human fecal metabolome, but diverse human lifestyles and behavior still maintain a shared human fecal metabolome. This study represents the first characterization of the shared human fecal metabolome through untargeted analyses of populations along an industrialization gradient.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001488	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8CT5G			Metabolomics reveals global metabolic changes between WT and SCAP deficient B cells	Cellular metabolism regulates almost all critical cellular activities including cell growth, proliferation, energy homeostasis and signaling transduction. SCAP controls SREBP signaling, an important pathway regulating cellular lipid biosynthesis. SCAP KO B cells have multiple defects and cannot form germinal centers. To test whether these defects of SCAP KO B cells are associated with an altered global metabolic state. We stimulated B cells isolated from SCAPfl/fl CD19Cre/+ mice (KO) and SCAP+/+ CD19Cre/+ mice (WT) with ?-CD40 or LPS for 24 and 48 hours, followed by targeted metabolomics analysis to evaluate global metabolic changes. We found that the metabolic profiles of unstimulated SCAP KO and WT B cells were largely overlapping, corroborating our findings that SCAP deficiency did not affect B cell development or their metabolic profile at steady state. In contrast, after stimulation with either LPS or ?-CD40, SCAP KO and WT B cells were clearly separated at 24 hours, with an even more pronounced separation at 48 hours. SREBP signaling can regulated the metabolism of many ceramides and sphingolipids. For example, lactosyl-N-palmitoyl-sphingosine (d18:1/16:0), one of the lactosylceramides (LacCer), is highly accumulated in SCAP KO B cells activated by either ?-CD40 or LPS. Strikingly, besides lipid metabolism, SCAP deficiency also alters many other metabolites that belong to different metabolic pathways such as energy, amino acids, peptide, cofactors and vitamins, nucleotide, carbohydrate, and xenobiotics. Taken together, the metabolomics analysis revealed previously unrecognized roles of SREBP signaling in regulating multiple cellular activities in activated B cells.

To delineate the role of SETD1A, we utilize a protein degrader technology to induce rapid SETD1A degradation in AML cell lines. SETD1A degradation results in immediate downregulation of transcripts associated with DNA repair and heme biosynthesis pathways. CRISPR-based functional analyses and metabolomics reveal an essential role of SETD1A to maintain mitochondrial respiration in AML cells. These SETD1A targets are enriched in head-to-head (H2H) genes. SETD1A degradation disrupts a non-enzymatic SETD1A domain-dependent cyclin K function, increases the Ser5P RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) at TSS, and induces the promoter-proximal pausing of RNAP2 in a strand-specific manner. This study reveals a non-enzymatic role for SETD1A in transcriptional pause release and provides insight into the mechanism of RNAP2 pausing and its function in cancer.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001490	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M84D89			Reducing the metabolic burden of rRNA synthesis promotes healthy longevity	Ribosome biogenesis is an anabolic process driven by RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-mediated synthesis of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA). While Pol I activity was previously linked to longevity, the underlying mechanisms were not studied beyond effects on protein translation and downstream proteostasis. Here we used multi-omics and functional tests to show that curtailment of Pol I activity preserves mitochondrial function and lowers ATP expenditure, thereby promoting longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Reduced pre-rRNA synthesis also improved longevity and energy homeostasis in Drosophila melanogaster and human cells, respectively. Conversely, the enhancement of pre-rRNA synthesis boosted growth and neuromuscular performance of young nematodes at the cost of accelerated metabolic decline, mitochondrial stress and premature aging. Moreover, restriction of Pol I activity extended lifespan more potently than translational repression, and retained its geroprotective effects when initiated late in life, showcasing moderation of Pol I activity as an effective longevity treatment not limited by aging.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001492	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8VX2Q			Metabolome and transcriptome analysis of oral mucosa of HIV+ patients reveal a role for polyamine metabolic pathway in T cell dysfunction	Metabolic changes of immune cells contribute to both physiological and pathophysiological outcomes of immune reactions. How viruses alter the metabolic states of mucosal T cells and the precise mechanisms underlying the persisting immune dysfunction during chronic viral infections are key questions that have not been fully addressed. Here, by comparing transcriptome and salivary metabolome profiles of the uninfected individuals and people living with HIV (PLWH) on treatment, we found a role of polyamine metabolism in immune perturbations of the oral mucosa of HIV+ patients. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed the higher expression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC-1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (EIF5A), the polyamine metabolism intermediates in CD4+ T cells in PLWH. Mechanistic studies using an in vitro human tonsil organoid infection model revealed that HIV infection of activated T cells also resulted in increased polyamine synthesis, which was dependent on the activities of caspase-1, IL-1ß, and ODC-1. HIV-1 also led to elevated dysfunctional regulatory T cells (TregDys) /Thelper 17 (Th17) cell ratios as well as heightened expression of ODC-1, EIF5A, and hypusinated EIF5A. Blockade of caspase-1, ODC-1, and EIF5A hypusination and not HIF-1? or NLRP3 reversed the frequency of TregDys showing the direct impact of polyamine pathway in Treg dysfunction during HIV-1 infection. The addition of exogenous polyamines increased TregDys percentages independent of HIV-1 infection in vitro. Finally, oral mucosal TregDys/Th17 ratios and CD4 hyperactivation positively correlated with the increases in salivary putrescine levels, which were found to be elevated in the saliva of PLWH. Thus, by revealing the role of aberrantly increased polyamine synthesis during HIV infection, our study unveils a new mechanism by which chronic viral infections could drive distinct T cell effector programs and Treg dysfunction.

Plant growth and development, as well as seed yield of Brassica crops, are severely affected due to this disease. Several reports described the molecular responses of B. napus to P. brassicae; however, information on the early stages of pathogenesis is limited. In this study, we have used metabolomics approach to characterize P. brassicae pathogenesis at 1-, 4-, and 7- days post-inoculation (DPI) in clubroot resistant (CR) and susceptible (CS) doubled-haploid (DH) lines. Several metabolites related to organic acids (e.g., citrate, pyruvate), amino acids (e.g., proline, aspartate), sugars, and mannitol, were differentially accumulated in roots in response to pathogen infection when the CR and CS genotypes were compared. Our results suggest important roles for these metabolites in mediating resistance to clubroot disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an integrated metabolome analysis aimed at characterizing the molecular basis of resistance to clubroot in canola.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001495	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8GM6Q			Comprehensive characterization of putative genetic influences on plasma metabolome in a pediatric cohort	Background: The human exposome is composed of diverse metabolites and small chemical compounds originated from endogenous and exogenous sources, respectively. Genetic and environmental factors influence metabolite levels while the extent of genetic contributions across metabolic pathways is not yet known. Untargeted profiling of human metabolome using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) combined with genome-wide genotyping allows comprehensive identification of genetically influenced metabolites. As such previous studies of adults discovered and replicated genotype-metabotype associations. However, these associations have not been characterized in children. Results: We conducted the largest genome by metabolome-wide association study to date of children (N=441) using 619,688 common genetic variants and 14,342 features measured by HRMS. Narrow-sense heritability (h2) estimates of plasma metabolite concentrations using genomic relatedness matrix restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) method showed a bimodal distribution with high h2 (>0.8) for 15.9% of features and low h2 (<0.2) for most of features (62.0%). The features with high h2 were enriched for amino acid and nucleic acid metabolism while carbohydrate and lipid concentrations showed low h2. For each feature, a metabolite quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analysis was performed to identify genetic variants that were potentially associated with plasma levels. Fifty-four associations among 29 features and 43 genetic variants were identified at a genome-wide significance threshold p < 3.5x10-12 (= 5 x 10-8/14,342 features). Previously reported associations such as UGT1A1 and bilirubin; PYROXD2 and methyl lysine; ACADS and butyrylcarnitine were successfully replicated in our pediatric cohort. We found potential candidates for novel associations including CSMD1 and a monostearyl alcohol triglyceride; CALN1 and a triglyceride; RBFOX1 and dimethylarginine. A gene-level enrichment analysis using MAGMA revealed highly interconnected modules for ADP biosynthesis, sterol synthesis, and long-chain fatty acid transport in the gene-feature network. Conclusion: Comprehensive profiling of plasma metabolome across age groups combined with genome-wide genotyping revealed a wide range of genetic influence on diverse chemical species and metabolic pathways. The developmental trajectory of a biological system is shaped by gene-environment interaction especially in early life. Therefore, continuous efforts on generating metabolomics data in diverse human tissue types across age groups are required to understand gene-environment interaction toward healthy aging trajectories.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition affecting 2.3% of 8-year-old children and is attributable to polygenic risks in most cases. Gene discovery studies catalogued >1000 genes with de novo, rare and common genetic variants that are likely associated with ASD; however, the candidate genes are rarely translated to diagnostic and treatment biomarkers. As such no pharmacological treatment option is available for targeting core symptoms. Neural circuits involved in verbal/nonverbal communications and social interaction are likely changed, which may be caused by an excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) imbalance in individuals with ASD. To date, clinical trials targeting excitatory glutamatergic or inhibitory GABAergic receptors showed mixed results. These early clinical trials highlight the unmet need of biomarkers for target populations and outcome indicators. We investigated whether plasma biomarkers would be associated with genetic risk factors and core symptoms of ASD. Plasma samples were collected for metabolomics profiling from the Autism Genetics Resource Exchange (AGRE). Detailed phenotype information is available at NIMH Data Archive (Collection ID: 4214) and can be accessed using NDAR GUID for the individuals.

Here, we generated a new Drosophila knock-in model of DNAJC6/Auxilin and find that the pathogenic mutation causes synaptic dysfunction, neurological defects and neurodegeneration, as well as specific lipid metabolism alterations. In these mutants, membrane lipids containing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, including phosphatidylinositol lipid species that are key for synaptic vesicle recycling and organelle function, are reduced. Overexpression of another protein mutated in Parkinson’s disease, Synaptojanin-1, known to bind and metabolize specific phosphoinositides, rescues the DNAJC6/Auxilin lipid alterations, the neuronal function defects and neurodegeneration. Our work reveals a functional relation between two proteins mutated in Parkinsonism and implicates deregulated phosphoinositide metabolism in the maintenance of neuronal integrity and neuronal survival.

With no sign of reversing this downward trajectory, we may not only be facing a fertility crisis, but low sperm count also has wider public health implications, including increased risks in morbidity and mortality. Given this dramatic decrease in sperm quality over a short period, genetic influences are likely not attributable, but rather, environmental factors encountered over the life-course. The objective of this pilot project is to determine the feasibility of generating metabolomic data from human seminal plasma collected as part of the ongoing SEEDS cohort.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001505	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85717			Stress-Induced Mucosal Layer Disruption Drives Gut Dysbiosis and Depressive-like Behaviors	Depression is a common mental health condition with a large social and economic impact. While depression etiology is multifactorial, chronic stress is a well-accepted contributor to disease onset. In addition, depression is associated with altered gut microbial signatures that can be replicated in animal models. While targeted restoration of the microbiome has been shown to reduce depressive-like behaviors in mice, the complexity and diversity of the human microbiome has complicated therapeutic intervention in patients. To circumvent these limitations, there is a critical need for identifying pathways responsible for microbiome dysbiosis. Here, for the first time, we identify the changes in host physiology that induce microbiome dysbiosis. Specifically, we show that a component of mucosal layer, the transmembrane protein mucin 13, can regulate microbiome composition. Using a model of chronic stress to induce behavioral and microbial changes in mice, we show a significant reduction in mucin 13 expression across the intestines that occurs independently of the microbiome. Furthermore, deleting Muc13 leads to gut dysbiosis, and baseline behavioral changes normally observed after stress exposure. Together, these results validate the hypothesis that mucosal layer disruption is an initiating event in stress-induced dysbiosis and offer mucin 13 as a potential new therapeutic target for microbiome dysbiosis in stress-induced depression. For the first time, our data provide an upstream and conserved target for treating microbiome dysbiosis, a result with sweeping implications for diseases presenting with microbial alterations.

If left without treatment, VL can cause death, especially in immunocompromised people. Current treatments have often significant adverse effects, and resistance has been reported in some countries. Determining the metabolites perturbed during VL can lead us to find new treatments targeting disease pathogenesis. We therefore compared metabolic perturbation between L. donovani-infected and uninfected hamsters across organs (spleen, liver, and gut). Metabolites were extracted, analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and processed with MZmine and molecular networking to annotate metabolites. We found few metabolites commonly impacted by infection across all three sites, including glycerophospholipids, ceramides, acylcarnitines, peptides, purines and amino acids. In accordance with VL symptoms and parasite tropism, we found a greater overlap of perturbed metabolites between spleen and liver compared to spleen and gut, or liver and gut. Targeting pathways related to these metabolite families would be the next focus that can lead us to find more effective treatments for VL.

This process results in a protein-RNA mixture that is chemically distinct from the surrounding aqueous phase. Here we use mass spectrometry to characterize the metabolomes of condensates. To test this, we prepared mixtures of phase-separated proteins and cellular metabolites and identified metabolites enriched in the condensate phase. These proteins included SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, as well as low complexity domains of MED1 and HNRNPA1.

Microbiota and the metabolites they produce shape food allergy risk. We performed a longitudinal, multi-center, integrative study of the gut microbiome and metabolome of 122 infants with allergy risk factors but no peanut allergy who were followed through mid childhood. 28.7% of infants developed peanut allergy by mid-childhood. Lower infant gut microbiome diversity was associated with peanut allergy development (P=0.014). Peanut allergy-bound children had different abundance trajectories of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 sp. (FDR=0.015) and Bifidobacterium sp. (FDR=0.033), with butyrate (FDR=0.045) and isovalerate (FDR=0.036) decreasing over time. Metabolites associated with peanut allergy development clustered within the histidine metabolism pathway. Positive correlations between microbiota, butyrate, and isovalerate and negative correlations with histamine marked the peanut allergy free network. The temporal dynamics of the gut microbiome and metabolome in early childhood are distinct for children who develop peanut allergy.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001514	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M80H6B			Lipidomics of deep-diving pinniped brains	The brain of diving mammals such as the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) exhibits a remarkable tolerance to low tissue oxygen levels (hypoxia). While neurons of most terrestrial mammals suffer irreversible damage after only short periods of hypoxia, in vitro experiments revealed that neurons of the hooded seal show prolonged functional integrity even in severe hypoxia. As major components of membranes, specific neuronal lipids of diving mammals could contribute to the observed high hypoxia tolerance. Therefore, we analyzed the brain lipidome of deep-diving pinnipeds (Cystophora cristata, Pagophilus groenlandicus) in comparison to terrestrial (non-diving) relatives (Mustela putorius furo, Mus musculus). Furthermore, lipid composition of C. cristata brain tissue was analyzed that was exposed to hypoxia and reoxygenation in vitro.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001515	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8VQ5S			Quantitative proteomics and lipidomics of TFG-deficient B cells provide insights into mechanisms of autophagic flux and plasma cell biology	The autophagy-flux-promoting protein TFG (Trk-fused gene) is up-regulated during B cell differentiation into plasma cells and supports survival of CH12 B cells. We hypothesized that quantitative proteomics analysis of CH12tfgKO B cells with intact or blocked autophagy-lysosome flux (via NH4Cl) will identify mechanisms of TFG-dependent autophagy, plasma cell biology and B cell survival. Analysis of CH12WT B cells in the presence of NH4Cl will identify proteins whose presence is continuously regulated by lysosomes independent of TFG. We determined hundreds of proteins to be controlled by TFG and/or NH4Cl. Notably, NH4Cl treatment alone increased the abundance of a cluster of cytosolic and mitochondrial translational proteins while it also reduced a number of proteins. Within the B cell relevant protein pool, BCL10 was reduced, while JCHAIN was increased in CH12tfgKO B cells. Furthermore, TFG regulated the abundance of transcription factors, such as JUNB, metabolic enzymes, such as the short-chain fatty acid activating enzyme ACOT9 or the glycolytic enzyme ALDOC. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that TFG-regulated proteins localized to mitochondria and membrane-bounded organelles. Due to these findings we performed shotgun lipidomics of glycerophospholipids, uncovering that a particular phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) species, PE 32:0, which lipidates LC3 most efficiently, was less abundant while phosphatidylglycerol (PG) was more abundant in CH12tfgKO B cells. In line with the role of PG as precursor for Cardiolipin (CL), the CL content was higher in CH12tfgKO B cells and addition of PG liposomes to B cells increased the amount of CL. We propose a role for TFG in B cell activation and plasma cell biology via regulation of proteins involved in germinal center and plasma cell development, such as BCL10 or JCHAIN, as well as in lipid homeostasis, mitochondria and metabolism.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001516	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8R12T			UCP2-dependent redox-sensing in POMC neurons regulates feeding	Paradoxically, glucose, the primary driver of satiety, activates a small population of anorexigenic POMC neurons. Here we show that lactate levels in the circulation and in the cerebrospinal fluid are elevated in fed state and addition of lactate to glucose activates the majority of POMC neurons while increasing cytosolic NADH generation, mitochondrial respiration and extracellular pyruvate levels. Inhibition of lactate dehydrogenases diminishes mitochondrial respiration, NADH production, and POMC neuronal activity. However, inhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier has no effect. POMC-specific downregulation of Ucp2 (Ucp2PomcKO), a molecule regulated by fatty acid metabolism and shown to play a role as transporter in the malate-aspartate shuttle, abolishes lactate- and glucose-sensing of POMC neurons. Ucp2PomcKO mice have impaired glucose metabolism and are prone to obesity on a high fat diet. Altogether, our data show that lactate through redox signaling and blocking mitochondrial glucose utilization activates POMC neurons to regulate feeding and glucose metabolism.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001524	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8Q13W			Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase supports macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome activation during acute inflammation	Activating macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome can promote excessive inflammation, with severe cell and tissue damage and organ dysfunction. Here, we show that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) significantly attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome activation in murine and human macrophages and septic mice by lowering caspase-1 cleavage and IL-1beta secretion. Inhibiting PDHK reverses NLRP3 inflammasome-induced metabolic reprogramming, enhances autophagy, promotes mitochondrial fusion over fission, preserves cristae ultrastructure, and attenuates mitochondrial ROS production. The suppressive effect of PDHK inhibition on the NLRP3 inflammasome is independent of its canonical role as a pyruvate dehydrogenase regulator. We suggest that PDHK inhibition improves mitochondrial fitness by reversing NLRP3 inflammasome activation in acutely inflamed macrophages.

Here we demonstrate that the catabolism of membrane phosphatidylcholine (PC) into water-soluble glycerophosphocholine (GPC) by the phospholipase/lysophospholipase PNPLA8-PNPLA7 axis enables endogenous choline stored in hepatic PC to be utilized in methyl metabolism. PNPLA7-deficient mice show marked decreases in hepatic GPC, choline, and several metabolites related to the methionine cycle, accompanied by various signs of methionine insufficiency including growth retardation, hypoglycemia, hypolipidemia, increased energy consumption, reduced adiposity, increased FGF21, and an altered histone/DNA methylation landscape. Moreover, PNPLA8-deficient mice recapitulate most of these phenotypes. In contrast to wild-type mice fed a methionine/choline-deficient diet, both knockout strains display a decreased hepatic triglyceride likely via reductions of lipogenesis and GPC-derived glycerol flux. Collectively, our findings highlight the biological importance of phospholipid catabolism driven by PNPLA8/PNPLA7 in methyl group flux and triglyceride synthesis in the liver.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001532	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8P11T			Deep multi-omic profiling reveals extensive mitochondrial remodeling driven by glycemia in early diabetic kidney disease	Changes in mitochondrial energy metabolism are thought to be central to the development of diabetic kidney disease (DKD); however, whether this response is explicitly driven by systemic glucose concentrations remains unknown. Here, we show that titrating blood glucose concentrations in vivo directly impacts mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics and remodels the mitochondrial proteome in the kidney in early DKD. Mitoproteomic analysis revealed profound metabolic disturbances induced by severe hyperglycemia, including upregulation of enzymes involved in the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism, enhanced ketogenesis as well as extensive dysregulation of the mitochondrial SLC25 carrier family. The metabolite and lipid landscape were perturbed by severe hyperglycemia; untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics confirmed the enrichment of TCA cycle metabolites, an increase in triglyceride concentrations, and extensive and specific cardiolipin remodeling. Lowering blood glucose to moderate hyperglycemia stabilized all three omic landscapes, partially prevented changes in mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics, and improved kidney injury. This study provides insights into altered substrate utilization and energy generation in the kidney early in diabetes, during moderate and severe hyperglycemia and has implications for therapeutic strategies aiming at the reinvigoration of mitochondrial function and signaling in diabetes.

In addition to increasing susceptibility to pathogenic infections (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 et al.), obesity promotes the development of many cancer subtypes and increases mortality rates in most cases. It has been demonstrated that, in the context of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), adipocytes promote multi-drug chemoresistance. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that B-ALL cells exposed to the adipocyte secretome alter their metabolic states to circumvent chemotherapy-mediated cytotoxicity. To better understand how adipocytes impact the function of human B-ALL cells, we used an untargeted metabolomics mass spectroscopy approach to define adipocyte-induced changes in B-cells. These analyses revealed that the adipocyte secretome directly modulates programs in human B-ALL cells which are associated with metabolism. In all, our data increases our understanding of pathways which may promote chemoresistance in human B-ALL.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001536	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8512J			Alterations in SHH signal transduction introduce a state of hypometabolism in sporadic Parkinson's disease	Sporadic Parkinson’s Disease (sPD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by multiple genetic and environmental factors with largely unknown etiology. Prominent pathological culprits include metabolic as well as mitochondrial alterations which have been identified in patients, however, their relevance at different stages of disease progression or their connection remains largely elusive. Here, human iPSCs from late-onset sPD patients were used for disease modeling. Following long-term in vitro cultivation, exclusively neural cells derived from sPD patients developed reduced mitochondrial respiration and glucose consumption reflecting an sPD-specific state of hypometabolism. A multilayered omics analysis based on transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics allowed us to identify the citric acid cycle as being the bottleneck in sPD metabolism. A 13C metabolic flux analysis further unraveled the a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex as being central for a reduced flux through the citric acid cycle. This resulted in a substrate availability problem for the electron transport chain and thus reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP production. Notably, these alterations in cellular metabolism were evoked by altered SHH signal transduction due to dysfunctional primary cilia. Upon inhibiting the enhanced SHH signal transduction in sPD, glucose uptake and the activity of the a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex could be restored. Thus, inhibiting overactive SHH signaling may be a potential neuroprotective therapy during the early stages of sPD.

DMXAA, a flavonoid derivative as a known agonist of STING, has been served as a promising antivascular agent. Although cGAS-STING activation has been demonstrated to mediate cisplatin-induced AKI, the role of DMXAA in this condition is unclear. Here, we defined an unexpected and critical role of DMXAA in improving renal function, ameliorating renal tubular injury and cell apoptosis, suppressing inflammation in cisplatin-induced AKI. Moreover, we confirmed that DMXAA combated AKI in a STING-independent manner evidenced by its protection against AKI in STING knockout mice. Due to the established role of metabolic disorders in AKI, which could contribute to the injury and kidney recovery, we performed metabolomics using renal tissues from cisplatin-induced AKI mice with or without DMXAA treatment. Strikingly, the date revealed that DMXAA improved the metabolic disorders in kidneys of AKI mice, especially restored the tryptophan metabolism.

The successful application of metabolomic and pro-teomic approaches relies on reproducibly quantifying a wide range of metabolites and proteins. Herein, we report the results of untargeted metabolomic and proteomic analyses from blood plasma samples following analyte extraction by two frequently used solvent systems: chloro-form/methanol and methanol-only. Whole blood samples were collected from participants (n=6) at University Hospital Sharjah (UHS) hospital, then plasma was separated and extracted by two methods i. methanol precipitation and, ii. 4:3 methanol:chloroform extraction. The coverage and reproducibility of the two methods were assessed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS). The study revealed that metabolite extraction by methanol-only showed greater reproducibility for both metabolomic and proteomic quantifications than did methanol/chloroform, while yielding similar peptide coverage. However, coverage of extracted metabolites was higher with the methanol/chloroform precipitation.

However, evolutionarily conserved circRNAs with potent functions in cancers are rarely reported. Here, we identified a mammalian conserved circRNA circLARP2 that played critical roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). With clinical specimens, we found that patients with high circLARP2 levels in HCC had advanced prognostic stage and poor overall survival. CircLARP2 facilitated HCC metastasis and lipid accumulation in HCC cell lines. CircLARP2 was one of the rare ones that were identified in HCC metastasis and conserved in mammals, which enabled further studies with animal models. CircLARP2-deficient mice exhibited reduced metastasis and less lipid accumulation in an induced HCC model. We provided lines of evidence at molecular, cellular, and whole organismal levels, to support that circLARP2 functioned as a protein sponge of AUF1. CircLARP2 sequestered AUF1 from binding to LKB1 mRNA, which led to decreased LKB1 mRNA stability and lower LKB1 protein levels. LKB1 as a kinase promoted the phosphorylation of AMPK and then the phosphorylation of ACC, the rate limiting enzyme of fatty acid synthesis. Knockdown of Lkb1 with AAV8-shLkb1 in mice HCC model also proved that Lkb1 was a key element in the regulation. Through this AUF1-LKB1-AMPK-ACC pathway, circLARP2 promoted HCC metastasis and lipid accumulation.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001545	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8099D			Lipidomics of Tango2 Deficient and Wildtype Zebrafish Muscle Tissue	Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical emergency characterized by severe muscle damage, resulting in the release of intracellular muscle components which leads to myoglobinuria and in severe cases, acute kidney failure. Rhabdomyolysis is caused by genetic factors that are linked to increased disease susceptibility in response to extrinsic triggers. Recessive mutations in TANGO2 result in episodic rhabdomyolysis, metabolic crises, encephalopathy, and cardiac arrhythmia. The underlying mechanism contributing to disease onset in response to specific triggers remains unclear. To address these challenges, we created a zebrafish model of Tango2 deficiency. Here we demonstrate that the loss of Tango2 in zebrafish results in growth defects, early lethality, and increased susceptibility of muscle defects similar to TANGO2 patients. Detailed analyses of skeletal muscle revealed defects in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria at the onset of disease development. The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) constitutes the primary lipid biosynthesis site and regulates calcium handling in skeletal muscle to control excitation-contraction coupling. Tango2 deficient SR exhibits increased sensitivity to calcium release that was partly restored by inhibition of Ryr1-mediated Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle. Using lipidomics, we identified alterations in the glycerolipid state of tango2 mutants which is critical for membrane stability and energy balance. Therefore, these studies provide insight into key disease processes in Tango2 deficiency and have increased our understanding of the impacts of specific defects on predisposition to environmental triggers in TANGO2-related disorders.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001546	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8VM64			Alcohol dehydrogenase 1B is crucial for adipocyte homeostasis.	Background. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1B), encoded by the ADH1B gene, is a cytosolic enzyme mainly known for its role in ethanol catabolism in the liver. A few studies have paved the way to show an equally important role of ADH1B in adipocytes. This study aimed to better identify the cellular mechanisms and signaling pathways involving ADH1B in adipose tissue and to determine if ADH1B variants might contribute to adipose tissue dysfunction. Results. We showed that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated ADH1B knockout (KO) in human adipose stem cells (ASC) abolished adipocyte differentiation and decreased insulin response. This was accompanied by oxidative stress, altered mitochondrial functions, and cellular senescence. Lipidomic analysis revealed that ADH1B deficiency results in a major remodeling of lipid composition in ASC. An ADH1B homozygous loss-of-function variant was also identified in a patient presenting with a lipodystrophic and insulin resistant syndrome associated with major liver dysfunction, leading to early death. Discussion. This translational study underlines the crucial role of ADH1B in adipose tissue. It unveils cellular mechanisms accounting for its key role in adipogenesis, and adipocyte homeostasis. This study also identifies ADH1B as a candidate gene in monogenic forms of lipodystrophic and insulin resistant syndromes.

Therefore, this work aims to investigate an in vitro primary astrocyte lineage model by untargeted metabolomics evaluations of two cellular subfractions: secretome and intracellular content after Aya treatment, where DMT and other ß-carbolines were previously quantified. Metabolomics analysis was performed by UHPLC-MS/MS, followed by MS-Dial data processing and statistical analysis to identify metabolites and biochemical alterations related to Aya treatment. Aya doses were applied to the cell cultures considering DMT concentrations of 1, 10 and 20 µM, which are in agreement with non-toxic and toxic DMT threshold assays in primary human astrocyte cells viability.

Silicon (Si) mitigates several stresses and enhances plant resistance to phytopathogens. We investigated the effects of Si on clubroot disease symptoms in canola at two concentrations of Si (Si1.0 and Si0.5). In addition, the effects of Si on P. brassicae-induced gene expression, endogenous levels of phytohormones and metabolites were also studied. Si application reduced clubroot symptoms and improved plant growth under greenhouse conditions. Pathogen-induced transcript-level changes were affected by Si treatment to P. brassicae with genes related to antioxidant activity, phytohormone biosynthesis and signalling, nitrogen metabolism and secondary metabolism exhibiting differential expression. Endogenous levels of several phytohormones (e.g., auxin, cytokinin, salicylic acid and abscisic acid), amino acids and secondary metabolites (e.g., glucosinolates) were affected by Si. This is the first report that Si ameliorates clubroot symptoms and its possible mode of action.

Here, we used a novel non-invasive, ingestible sampling device to probe the spatiotemporal variation of upper intestinal luminal contents during routine daily digestion in 15 healthy subjects. We analyzed 274 intestinal samples and 60 corresponding stool homogenates by combining five metabolomics assays and 16S rRNA sequencing. We identified 1,909 metabolites, including sulfonolipids and novel bile acids. Stool and intestinal metabolomes differed dramatically. Food metabolites displayed known differences and trends in dietary biomarkers, unexpected increases in dicarboxylic acids along the intestinal tract, and a positive association between luminal keto acids and fruit intake. Diet-derived and microbially linked metabolites accounted for the largest inter-subject differences. Interestingly, subjects exhibited large variation in levels of bioactive fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) and sulfonolipids. Two subjects who had taken antibiotics within 6 months prior to sampling showed markedly different patterns in these and other microbially related metabolites; from this variation, we identified Blautia species as most likely to be involved in FAHFA metabolism. Thus, in vivo sampling of the human small intestine under physiologic conditions can reveal links between diet, host and microbial metabolism.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001550	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8BM6G			Multi-omic Analysis of ClpP Activation in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells	The ClpP activators ONC201 and related small molecules (TR compounds, Madera Therapeutics), have demonstrated significant anti-cancer potential in an array of in vitro cell models and in vivo studies, including clinical trials for refractory solid tumors. Though progress has been made in identifying specific phenotypic outcomes following ClpP activation, the exact mechanism by which ClpP activation leads to broad anti-cancer activity has yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we utilized a multi-omics approach to identify the ClpP-dependent proteomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic changes resulting from ONC201 or the TR compound TR-57 in triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBC). Applying mass spectrometry- based methods of proteomics and metabolomics, we identified ~8000 proteins and 588 metabolites, respectively. From proteomics data, approximately 3400 (ONC201) and 3000 (TR-57) proteins increased and ~4600 (ONC201) and ~4800 (TR-57) proteins decreased in this study. Additionally, gene ontological analysis revealed strong similarities between proteins up- or downregulated by ONC201 or TR-57 treatment. Notably, this included the downregulation of many mitochondrial processes and proteins, including mitochondrial translation and mitochondrial matrix proteins. We also performed a large-scale transcriptomic analysis of WT SUM159 cells, identifying ~7700 transcripts (~3600 and 3800 increasing, ~4000 and 3900 decreasing in ONC201 and TR-57 treated cells, respectively). Less than 21% of these genes were affected by these compounds in ClpP null cells. Gene ontological analysis of these data demonstrated additional similarity of response to ONC201 and TR-57. Many of the same gene ontology processes and cellular components were identified, including a decrease in transcripts related to the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix, the cell cycle, and the nucleus, as well as increases in other nuclear transcripts and transcripts related to metal-ion binding. Comparative analysis demonstrated a highly analogous response in all -omics datasets. Analysis of metabolites also revealed significant similarities between ONC201 and TR-57 with increases in a-ketoglutarate and 2-hydroxyglutaric acid and decreased levels of ureidosuccinic acid, L-ascorbic acid, L-serine, and cytidine observed following ClpP activation in TNBC cells. Further analysis identified multiple pathways that were specifically impacted by ClpP activation, including ATF4 activation, heme biosynthesis, and the citrulline/urea cycle. In summary the results of our studies demonstrate that ONC201 and TR-57 induce highly similar and broad effects against multiple mitochondrial processes required for cell proliferation.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001552	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8342Z			Metabolic effects of the protein kinase R	Spleen-derived macrophage from WT or Eif2ak2-/- (gene encoding PKR protein kinase) mice are treated with a synthetic RNA mimetic (polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid) to activate the kinase and metabolites were collected for analysis. The data identified 325 putative metabolites in the cell extracts, with a large number of significant differences between the Eif2ak2- /- and WT sample groups. Metabolite levels are predominantly suppressed in the WT compared to the Eif2ak2-/- cells, with depletion of specific metabolites in amino acid, carbohydrate, lipid and nucleotide pathways, while several amino acid metabolites were significantly elevated in the WT cells compared to the Eif2ak2-/-. The changes appear to delineate a pseudo-starvation response in the WT cells. Phosphate energy metabolism is altered with decreased creatine and phosphocreatine and a compensatory increase in phosphorylated guanidinoacetate in the WT compared to the Eif2ak2- /- cells. There appears to be a constraint in glycolysis in the WT cells, most clearly in the pentose phosphate pathway.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001553	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8ZB01			IFN-inducible phospholipid levels govern endosomal antiviral immunity	The interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are implicated in several biological processes including antiviral defense, but their modes of action remain debated. Here, taking advantage of pseudotyped viral entry assays and replicating viruses, we uncover the requirement of host co-factors for endosomal antiviral inhibition through high-throughput proteomics and lipidomics in cellular models of IFITM restriction. Unlike plasma membrane (PM)-localized IFITM restriction that targets infectious SARS-CoV2 and other PM-fusing viral envelopes, inhibition of endosomal viral entry depends on lysines within the conserved IFITM intracellular loop. These residues recruit phosphatydilinositol-3-phosphate (PIP3) that we show here to be required for endosomal IFITM activity. We identify PIP3 as an IFN-inducible phospholipid that acts as a rheostat for endosomal antiviral immunity as its expression levels correlated with the potency of endosomal IFITM restriction and exogenous PIP3 enhanced inhibition of endocytic viruses including the recent SARS-CoV2 Omicron variant. Together, our results identify PIP3 levels as a critical regulator of endosomal IFITM restriction linking it to the Pi3K/Akt/mTORC pathway and elucidate cell-compartment specific antiviral mechanisms, informing the development of broadly acting antiviral strategies.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001554	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8TM6T			Mass spectrometry dataset of LC-MS Lipidomics Analysis of Xenopus Laevis Optic Nerve	CNS injuries of the anuran amphibian, Xenopus laevis, are uniquely befitted for studying the molecular compositions of neuronal regeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) due to a functional recovery of optic axons disparate to adult mammalian analogues. RGCs and their optic nerve axons undergo irreversible neurodegeneration in glaucoma and associated optic neuropathies, resulting in blindness in mammals. Conversely, Xenopus demonstrates RGC lifetime-spanning regenerative capabilities after optic nerve crush, inciting opportunities to compare de novo regeneration and develop efficient pharmaceutical approaches for vision restoration. Studies revealing lipidome alterations during optic nerve regeneration are sparse and could serve as a solid foundation for these underlying molecular changes. We profile the lipid changes in a transgenic line of 1 year old Xenopus laevis Tg(islet2b:gfp) frogs that were either left untreated (naïve) or had a monocular surgery of either a left optic crush injury (crush) or sham surgery (sham). Matching controls of uninjured right optic nerves were also collected (control). Tg(islet2b:gfp) frogs were allowed to recover for 7,12,18, and 27 days post optic nerve crush. Following euthanasia, the optic nerves were collected for lipidomic analysis. A modified Bligh and Dyer method [PMID: 13671378] was used for lipid extraction, followed by untargeted mass spectrometry lipid profiling with a Q-Exactive Orbitrap Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (LC MS-MS) coupled with Vanquish Horizon Binary UHPLC LC-MS system.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001555	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8PT4W			Proteomics and metabolomics of multiple sclerosis	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the myelination of the neurons present in the central nervous system (CNS). The exact etiology of MS development is unclear, but various environmental and genetic factors might play a role in initiating the disease. Current treatments for MS enhance the quality of life and reduce the symptoms. One of these treatments is dimethyl fumarate (DMF), commercially known as Tecfidera. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a mouse model that is used to study the pathophysiology of MS disease as well as the effects of possible therapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated the effects of SIMR1707 which is a novel compound designed at Sharjah Institute for Medical Research (SIMR). . Single and multiple doses of SIMR1707 demonstrated high safety in mice studies. Treatment of EAE mice with SIMR1707 was able to reduce the EAE clinical scores and maintain their body weight similar to the MS FDA-approved (DMF, Tecfidera), when they were used preventively, prophylactically, or therapeutically. The histological and immunohistochemistry evaluations showed reduced clinical features such as signs of inflammation, demyelination, and infiltration of CD3-positive T cells into the brains of the EAE mice, as compared to vehicle-treated, or untreated EAE mice. Moreover, multi-OMICS experiments including Transcriptomics, Proteomics and Metabolomics were performed to gain insights into the relevant mechanism of action of the SIMR1707 in EAE and thus its therapeutic efficacy to treat MS. Same tissue samples extracted from the cerebellum part of the brain of normal, EAE vehicle-treated, and therapeutic SIMR1707 treated mice, were subjected for the whole RNA-sequencing for transcriptomics, Nano MS for proteomics analysis and LC-MS metabolomics analysis. The multi-OMICs integrative analysis showed that the treatment with SIMR1707 downregulated key biomarkers functionally associated with top pathways including calcium signaling, PI3K/AKT, and mTOR signaling pathways, which may play important roles in EAE and MS pathophysiology. Additionally, the metabolomics-based enriched-for-action pathway analysis showed that the top significantly activated metabolites (FC > 2, p < 0.05) are cholic acid, propionic acid, sphinganine, and nutriacholic acid. Consisting with the functional enrichment pathway analysis, two potent markers, Snta1 and Fscn1, involved in the actin-binding and cytoskeleton are commonly shared between transcriptomics and proteomics and showed mRNA-protein expression correlation in SIMR1707 treated compared to vehicle EAE mice. Importantly, these two markers are involved in the MT2/AKT/GSK3 pathway and may potentially play role in MS and EAE disease

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001559	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85X3W			UBXD8 lipidomics from whole cells	The intimate association between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial membranes at ER-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCS) serves as a platform for several critical cellular processes, in particular lipid synthesis. Enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis are enriched at contacts and membrane lipid composition at contacts is distinct relative to surrounding membranes. How contacts are remodeled and the subsequent biological consequences of altered contacts such as perturbed lipid metabolism remains poorly understood. Here we investigate if the ER-tethered ubiquitin-X domain adaptor 8 (UBXD8) regulates the lipidome of cells. LC-MS/MS lipidomics found significant changes in distinct lipid species in UBXD8 knockout cells, in particular in saturated or mono-unsaturated lipid species. Perturbation of contacts and inherent lipid synthesis is emerging as a hallmark in a variety of human disorders such as neurodegeneration. Our results suggest that contacts are exquisitely sensitive to alterations to membrane lipid composition and saturation in a manner that is dependent on UBXD8.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001560	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8242N			Integrated gut microbiome and lipidomic analyses in animal models of Wilson disease reveal a role of intestine ATP7B in copper-related metabolic dysregulation	Although the main pathogenic mechanism of Wilson disease (WD) is related to copper accumulation in the liver and brain, there is limited knowledge about the role of ATP7B copper transporter in extra-hepatic organs, including the intestine, and how it could affect metabolic manifestations of the disease. The aims of the present study were to profile and correlate the gut microbiota and lipidome in mouse models of WD, and to study the metabolic effects of intestine-specific ATP7B deficiency in a newly generated mouse model. Animal models of WD presented reduced gut microbiota diversity compared to mice with normal copper metabolism. Comparative prediction analysis of the functional metagenome showed the involvement of several pathways including amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolisms. Lipidomic profiles showed dysregulated tri- and diglyceride, phospholipid, and sphingolipid metabolism. When challenged with a high-fat diet, Atp7b?IEC mice confirmed profound deregulation of fatty acid desaturation and sphingolipid metabolism pathways as well as altered APOB48 distribution in intestinal epithelial cells. Gut microbiome and lipidomic analyses reveal integrated metabolic changes underlying the systemic manifestations of WD. Intestine-specific ATP7B deficit affects both intestine and systemic response to high-fat challenge. WD is as systemic disease and organ-specific ATP7B variants can explain the varied phenotypic presentations.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001562	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8SM54			Mass Spectrometry-based Proteomic and Metabolomic profiling of serum samples for discovery and validation of Tuberculosis diagnostic biomarker signature	Tuberculosis (TB) is a transmissible disease listed as one of the 10 leading causes of death worldwide (10 million infected in 2019). A swift and precise diagnosis is essential to forestall its transmission, for which is crucial the discovery of effective diagnostic biomarkers. In this study, we aimed to discover molecular biomarkers for the early diagnosis of tuberculosis. Two independent cohorts comprising 29 and 34 subjects were assayed by proteomics, and 49 were included for metabolomic analysis. All subjects were arranged into 3 experimental groups – healthy controls (Controls), Latent TB infection (LTBI) and TB patients. LC-MS/MS blood serum protein and metabolite levels were submitted to univariate, multivariate and ROC analysis. From the 149 proteins quantified in the discovery set, 25 were found to be differentially abundant between Controls and TB patients. The AUC, specificity and sensitivity, determined by ROC statistical analysis of the model composed by four of these proteins considering both proteomic sets, were 0.96; 93% and 91%, respectively. The five metabolites (9-methyluric acid, indole-3-lactic acid, trans-3-indoleacrylic acid, hexanoylglycine and N-acetyl-L-leucine) that better discriminate the control and TB patient groups (VIP > 1.75) from a total of 92 metabolites quantified in both ionization modes, were submitted to ROC analysis. An AUC=1 was determined with all samples being correctly assigned to the respective experimental group. An integrated ROC analysis enrolling 1 protein and 4 metabolites was also performed for the common control and TB patients in the proteomic and metabolomic groups. This combined signature has correctly assigned the 12 controls and 12 patients used only for prediction (AUC=1, specificity=100% and sensitivity=100%). This multi-omics approach has revealed a biomarker signature for tuberculosis diagnosis that could be potentially used for developing a point-of-care diagnosis clinical test.

Response to Abiotic Stresses: Part One—Salinity	Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is the number one source of consumed vegetable oil nowadays. It is cultivated in areas of tropical rainforest, where it meets its natural condition of high rainfall throughout the year. The palm oil industry faces criticism due to a series of practices that was considered not environmentally sustainable, and it finds itself under pressure to adopt new and innovative procedures to reverse this negative public perception. Cultivating this oilseed crop outside the rainforest zone is only possible using artificial irrigation. Close to 30% of the world’s irrigated agricultural lands also face problems due to salinity stress. Consequently, the research community must consider drought and salinity together when studying to empower breeding programs in order to develop superior genotypes adapted to those potential new areas for oil palm cultivation. Multi-Omics Integration (MOI) offers a new window of opportunity for the non-trivial challenge of unraveling the mechanisms behind multigenic traits, such as drought and salinity tolerance. The current study carried out a comprehensive, large-scale, single-omics analysis (SOA), and MOI study on the leaves of young oil palm plants submitted to very high salinity stress. Taken together, a total of 1239 proteins were positively regulated, and 1660 were negatively regulated in transcriptomics and proteomics analyses. Meanwhile, the metabolomics analysis revealed 37 metabolites that were upreg- ulated and 92 that were downregulated. After performing SOA, 436 differentially expressed (DE) full-length transcripts, 74 DE proteins, and 19 DE metabolites underwent MOI analysis, revealing sev- eral pathways affected by this stress, with at least one DE molecule in all three omics platforms used. The Cysteine and methionine metabolism (map00270) and Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis (map00010) pathways were the most affected ones, each one with 20 DE molecules.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001564	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8J41M			Linking genetic and phenotypic changes in the long term evolution experiment using metabolomics	The metabolome of a cell is the integration point of an organism's environment, genetics, and gene expression pattern. The metabolic phenotype can be under selection and is known to contribute to adaption. However, the metabolome's inherent networked and convoluted nature makes relating mutations, metabolic changes, and effects on fitness challenging. To overcome this challenge, we use the Long Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE) as a model to understand how mutations can transduce themselves through a cellular network, eventually affecting metabolism and perhaps fitness. We used mass-spectropscopy to broadly survey the metabolomes of both ancestors and all 12 evolved lines and combined this with genomic and expression data to suggest how mutations that alter specific reaction pathways, such as the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, might increase fitness in the system. Our work brings the field closer to a complete genotype-phenotype map for the LTEE and a better understanding of how mutations might affect fitness through the metabolome.

Here we advance a versatile approach to elaborate cellular metabolism in obligate anaerobes using the pathogen Clostridioides difficile, an amino acid and carbohydrate-fermenting Clostridia. High-Resolution Magic Angle Spinning (HRMAS) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of C. difficile, grown with fermentable 13C substrates, informed dynamic flux balance analysis (dFBA) of the pathogen’s genome-scale metabolism. Analyses identified dynamic recruitment of oxidative and supporting reductive pathways, with integration of high-flux amino acid and glycolytic metabolism at alanine’s biosynthesis to support efficient energy generation, nitrogen handling, and biomass generation. Model predictions informed an approach leveraging the sensitivity of 13C NMR spectroscopy to simultaneously track cellular carbon and nitrogen flow from [U-13C]glucose and [15N]leucine, confirming the formation of [13C,15N]alanine. Findings identify metabolic strategies used by C. difficile to support its rapid colonization and expansion in gut ecosystems.

Herein, we analyzed the metabolic changes induced by the p.S59L CHCHD10 mutation to identify new therapeutic opportunities. Using metabolomic, lipidomic and proteomic analysis we observed a strong alteration of metabolism in plasma and heart of Chchd10S59L/+ mice compared to their wild type littermates at pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages. In plasma, levels of phospholipids were decreased while those of carnitine derivatives and most of amino acids were increased. The cardiac tissue from Chchd10S59L/+ mice showed a decreased Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and ß-oxidation proteins levels as well as tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates and carnitine pathway metabolism. In parallel, lipidomics analysis reveals a drastic change in the lipidome, including triglyceride, cardiolipin and phospholipids. Consistent with this energetic deficiency in cardiac tissue, we show that L-acetylcarnitine supplementation improves the mitochondrial network length in IPS-derived cardiomyocytes from a patient carrying the CHCHD10S59L/+ mutation. These data indicate that a bioenergetic intermediate such as L-acetylcarnitine may restore mitochondrial function in CHCHD10-related disease, due to the reduction in energy deficit that could be compensated by carnitine metabolic pathways.

Acute ozone exposure has previously been implicated in airway inflammation, airway hyperreactivity, and other characteristics of asthma. Altered sphingolipid metabolism following ozone exposure may contribute to the molecular mechanisms underlying these previously reported effects. This study aimed to identify changes in metabolomic profiles and characteristics of asthma in allergen-sensitized mice following ozone exposure to provide insights regarding mechanisms of ozone-induced exacerbations in asthma. Adult male and female BALB/c mice were sensitized intranasally to house dust mite allergen (HDM) on days 1, 3, and 5 followed by HDM challenge on days 12-14. Mice were subsequently exposed to ozone following each HDM challenge for 6 hr/day. Bronchoalveolar lavage, plasma, whole lung lobes, and microdissected lung airways were collected from 8 female and 8 male mice for metabolomics analysis. 6 female and 6 male mice underwent methacholine challenge using a forced oscillation technique to assess pulmonary function. HDM-sensitized male mice exposed to ozone displayed synergistically increased airway hyperreactivity as well as increased airway inflammation and eosinophilia relative to control mice. Effects in male mice were significantly more severe than the effects observed in females. Both HDM-sensitized male and female mice exposed to ozone displayed significant decreases in multiple classes of sphingolipids in microdissected airways. However, glycosphingolipids were significantly increased in females and to a lesser extent in males. These results potentially implicate glycosphingolipids in protecting against severe outcomes of ozone exposure that coincide with exacerbation of allergic asthma.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001573	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8CD9V			Alterations in CSF Urea Occur in Late Manifest Stage Huntington Disease	Huntington Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in the Huntingtin gene, resulting in the production of mutant huntingtin proteins (mHTT). Previous research has identified urea as a key metabolite elevated in HD animal models and post-mortem tissues of HD patients. The exact timing of these elevations in urea and the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for these disturbances remain unknown. To better understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for elevations in urea in HD, we completed a global metabolomic profile of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from individuals who were at several stages of disease: pre-manifest (PRE), manifest (MAN), and late-manifest (LATE) HD participants compared to controls. We found approximately 500 metabolites were significantly altered in pre-manifest participants compared to controls, although no significant difference in CSF urea or urea metabolites. Interestingly, CSF urea was only significantly elevated in LATE participants compared to controls. There were no changes in the urea metabolites, citrulline, ornithine and arginine throughout disease; however, we did observe changes in acetate, creatinine, 4-acetamidobutanoate and 4-aminobutyraldehyde which are indirect modifiers of urea. Overall, our study confirms that elevations in urea do occur in HD, albeit later in disease and that these changes may reflect more central impairments to cellular energy metabolism yet to be explored.

Evaluation of tissue metabolomic changes in active zebrafish optic nerve regeneration can elucidate prioritized metabolite pathways to be targeted in mammalian systems for therapeutic development. Female and male (6 month to 1 year old) right Zebrafish (Tg(gap43:GFP)) optic nerves were crushed and collected three days after. The associated retinas and tecta were also collected under the same conditions for metabolic analysis. Contralateral, uninjured optic nerves, retinas and tecta were collected as controls. The three tissue types (optic nerve, retina, and tectum) were dissected from euthanized fish and frozen on dry ice. Optic nerve samples were pooled for each category (female crush, female control, male crush, male control) and pooled at n = 31 to obtain sufficient metabolite concentrations for analysis. Retina and tectum samples were pooled using the same categories (female crush, female control, male crush, male control) at n = 10-12. Regeneration was verified by microscope visualization of GFP fluorescence. Metabolites were extracted using a Precellys Homogenizer and a serial extraction method: (1) 1:1 Methanol/Water and (2) 8:1:1 Acetonitrile/Methanol/Acetone. Metabolites were analyzed by untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC MS-MS) profiling using a Q-Exactive Orbitrap instrument coupled with Vanquish Horizon Binary UHPLC LC-MS system. Metabolites were identified and quantified using Compound Discoverer 3.3 and isotopic internal metabolite standards.

Eicosanoids, a class of bioactive lipids, play a major regulatory role in these physiologies. In this study, the ablation of the ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) interaction site in the eicosanoid biosynthetic enzyme, group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2, in mice (cPLA2a-KI mice) resulted in enhanced and sustained neutrophil infiltration into both wounds and the peritoneum during the inflammatory phase of wound healing and sepsis. Enhanced neutrophil infiltration (i.e., neutrophilia) was associated with significant improvements in wound healing and the survival of mice to sepsis. As neutrophilia at the site of injury or infection normally associates with a poor outcome, our laboratory investigated this Neutrophil Conundrum by characterizing the cPLA2a-KI neutrophils, which showed enhanced N2-subtype markers, trans-endothelial migration, phagocytosis and VEGF with a concomitant decrease in TNFa, neutrophil extracellular trap production, N1-subtype markers, and endothelial cell damage versus wild-type neutrophils. This N2 polarization of cPLA2a-KI neutrophils was due to an induction of the 5-HETE/5-oxo-ETE biosynthetic pathway and activation of the OXER1 receptor. Unbiased proteomics identified perturbations in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) specific to OXER1 signaling in the cPLA2a-KI neutrophils, and modulation of the PPP recapitulated specific aspects of the N2 phenotype. Thus, C1P via cPLA2a negatively regulates 5-oxo-ETE biosynthesis, which controls neutrophil polarization via the PPP

We hypothesized that crocodiles have developed mechanisms to achieve such longevity while surviving under stressful conditions. We speculate that their microbial gut flora may produce substances contributing to their “hardiness” and “longevity”. Previously we characterized selected microbial gut bacteria colonizing the gastrointestinal tract of Crocodylus porosus (CP) using 16S rDNA sequencing. Next, bacterial conditioned media containing gut microbial metabolites were prepared. Bioassay-guided testing of selected bacterial conditioned media using LC-TIMS-QTOF MS, revealed the identity of gut microbial metabolites. Among two bacterial conditioned media, i.e., CP27 and 36, the analyses resulted in 141 highly confidently (MS/MS) identified metabolites in both samples. The pairwise comparison of the two samples indicated that 109 metabolites change significantly between them (p <0.05). Among abundant metabolites more prevalent in CP36 there were 2-Methyl-4-nitroimidazole, N-Acetyl-L-tyrosine, Acetaminophen, Trans-Ferulic acid, N, N-Dimethylformamide, Pyrocatechol, Cyclohexanone, 3, 4-Dihydrozphenylglycol, Diphenhydramine, Melatonin, Gamma –terpinene. Whereas in CP27 samples the most abundant metabolites were Carbamazepin, deoxyninosine, Cysteamine, Benzylnicotinate, 3-phenoxypropionic acid, Indole-3-carbinol, Benzaldehyde, Benzocaine, 2-Aminobenzoic acid, 3-Methylindole. Functional enrichment analysis of all identified metabolites with metabolite sets based on drug pathways showed that they were enriched for drug action of top ten pathways associating with enalapril metabolism pathway, diphenhydramine H1-Antihistamine action, enalarpil action pathway, benzocaine action pathway, mepivacaine action pathway, oxybuprocaine action pathways, nifedipine action pathway, propranolol action pathway, acetaminophen metabolism pathway, carbamazepine metabolism pathway. These findings suggest that analyses of crocodile gut bacteria may reveal potential drug leads, intensive future research is needed to realize these expectations.

However, the development of cancer often takes many years following initial infection and requires the virus to be able to persist and replicate within the host. Measuring metabolic changes immediately after HPV18 establishment will enable early metabolic changes associated with HPV18 persistence to be determined. Here, we compare the metabolic profiles of HPV18 genome-containing primary human foreskin keratinocytes from six donors, compared to donor-matched untransfected controls. The aim was to identify metabolic and lipid changes associated with HPV establishment in primary human foreskin keratinocytes.

Here, we combined bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics with cell-specific and spatially resolved metabolic analyses to systematically address the role of APOE across age, neuroinflammation, and AD pathology. RNAseq highlighted immunometabolic changes across the APOE4 glial transcriptome, specifically in subsets of metabolically distinct microglia enriched in the E4 brain during aging or following an inflammatory challenge. E4 microglia display increased Hif1a expression, a disrupted TCA cycle, and are inherently pro-glycolytic, while spatial transcriptomics and MALDI mass spectrometry imaging highlight an E4-specific response to amyloid that is characterized by widespread alterations in lipid metabolism. Taken together, our findings emphasize a central role for APOE in regulating microglial immunometabolism.

We aimed to determine how inherited mutations that cause FTD affect the brain lipidome. Both heterozygous GRN mutations and C9orf72 repeat expansions cause FTD with TDP-43 pathology, but GRN mutation carriers appear to have significant white matter pathology as seen by MRI. Our study uncovered significant loss of myelin sphingolipids in the heavily affected superior frontal white matter in both FTD groups, but GRN carriers show more severe myelin attrition than C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers. GRN carriers also showed selective increase in cholesterol esters and sphingosine in the less affected superior parietal white matter.

Metabolomics holds the promise to measure and quantify small molecules comprehensively in biological systems, and LC-MS (liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry) has become the leading technology in the field. Significant challenges still exist in the computational processing of data from LC-MS metabolomic experiments into metabolite features, including provenance and reproducibility of the current software tools. We present here, an experiment designed as serial mixtures of vegetable juice/Water and human plasma at varying ratios, nicknamed “Bloody Mary 21(BM21) to test semi-quantification at –omics scale. A subset of features are expected to have their peak areas correlated with the mixing ratio.

However, it has been unknown how PLA2G5 plays a role in sepsis. To study the role of PLA2G5 in sepsis, we performed lipidomics analysis of plasma and tissues from LPS-injected mice with or without PLA2G5 blockade. Here, we showed that PLA2G5 is involved in the production of fatty acids such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, lysophospholipids such as lysophosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophatidylethanolamine, and lysophosphatidylserine species, and metabolites derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and linoleic acids during sepsis. Thus, PLA2G5 regulates selective lipid pathways during sepsis.

Among the known EDCs, 17-a-ethinylestradiol (EE2) is characterized by high estrogenic potency, chemical stability, and a tendency to accumulate in aquatic biota. This hormone reaches the environment mainly through human and animal excretion, with conventional WWTP processes not fully managing its removal from treated effluents. Bivalves are excellent model organisms to assess the toxicity of several environmental stressors. Alongside the impacts of pollutants, organisms in coastal ecosystems are also subjected to climate change-related factors, such as temperature rise. Water temperature may increase up to 4 °C by 2100 and this is expected to severely impact several aspects of marine organisms’ biology. In addition, these environmental changes are also likely to affect the sensitivity of organisms to pollutants and, hence, pollutants toxicity. In this study, a comprehensive untargeted 1H NMR metabolomics strategy was applied to measure the metabolic impact of sea warming, in tandem with exposure to EE2, on Ruditapes philippinarum clams. The clams were exposed to different EE2 concentrations, either at 17 °C as control temperature or at 21 °C (representing a 4 °C increase, which corresponds to the worst-case warming scenario). The obtained data added important knowledge, unveiling individual metabolic effects of temperature rise and synergetic effects upon EE2 exposure, and paving the way for the definition of new metabolic markers for the monitoring of environmental stressors.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001585	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8TD8H			Mouse kidney metabolomic studies	Chronic kidney disease secondary to cystic kidney disease is a leading cause of mortality in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) disease. The mechanisms underlying TSC cystic kidney disease are obscure, with no interventions available to prevent cyst formation. Here, we reveal for the first time the misregulated metabolic pathways in TSC kidneys and their relevance to TSC-associated cytogenesis. To this end, we have analyzed the metabolic profile of the whole kidney as well as sorted proximal tubule cell (PTCs) extracts. The metabolomics data show that Tsc1 deletion in nephron progenitor cells changes the arginine biosynthesis pathway as well as a substantial number of metabolic pathways. These changes were associated with overexpression of argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1), a rate-limiting enzyme in the arginine biosynthetic pathway in TSC KO mice and human kidneys. The rise in ASS1 expression is dependent on mTORC1 activity. Arginine depletion in vitro and in vivo prevented the rise in mTORC1 activity and cell cycle progression and averted the overexpression of previously described cytogenetic signaling proteins, including c-Myc and P65. Accordingly, an arginine-depleted diet substantially reduced the TSC cystic load, indicating the potential therapeutic effects of arginine deprivation as a treatment of TSC-associated kidney disease.

However, little is still known about the potential input of its metabolome and particularly concerning a potential molecular sexual dimorphism observable in the different tissues of this organism. In an ecotoxicological point of view, inter-sex and inter-organ differences of the metabolomes may introduce analytical bias and impact the robustness of the analysis and its interpretation. To explore such possibilities, we obtained qualitative metabolomic data from the analysis of different organs of mature male and female Palaemon serratus. We used ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-HRMS on positive mode) to characterize the 75%-extracted metabolome of both gills, hepatopancreas, nervous gland, muscle and gonads.

Previous work by our group identified AHR activators in human feces, yet it is not clear if these activators are also present in circulation. To address this question, we quantified Trp metabolites in human serum. To mitigate the variable effect of diet on metabolite profiles, we analyzed sera samples collected from study participants fed a defined diet. As with the previously discussed mouse sera, targeted metabolomics was performed on serum samples using LC-MS.

Analyzing murine sera to investigate into which tryptophan metabolites in the host circulation are derived from diet, host metabolism and/or the gut microbiome. Blood was collected from the portal vein of conventional C567BL/6J mice and sera analyzed by targeted LC-MS. To test this hypothesis and evaluate the necessity of microorganisms to produce these examined tryptophan metabolites, sera were collected from germ-free (GF) mice and subjected to the same targeted metabolomic analysis. Having generated Trp metabolite profiles from sera, we asked if altering the diet would significantly change circulating concentrations. One of two groups of conventional C57BL/6J mice with ad libitum access to a standard laboratory chow were switched onto a semi-purified diet (AIN-93G) while the second remained on standard chow. After one week, portal vein blood was collected and analyzed using targeted LC-MS.

Although this treatment is known to trigger pro-inflammatory immune responses, it also results in several immune resistance mechanisms such as the upregulation of CD47 by tumors leading to avoidance of phagocytosis and the overexpression of PD-L1 in tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMCs). Leveraging these RT-elicited processes, we generated a bispecific-lipid nanoparticle (B-LNP) that engaged TAMCs to glioma cells via anti-CD47/PD-L1 dual-ligation. We show that B-LNP blocked these two vital immune checkpoint molecules and promoted the phagocytic activity of TAMCs. In order to boost subsequent T cell recruitment and antitumor activity after tumor engulfment, the B-LNP was encapsulated with diABZI, a non-nucleotidyl agonist for stimulator of interferon genes (STING). In vivo treatment with the diABZI-loaded B-LNP induced a transcriptomic and metabolic switch in TAMCs, transforming them into potent antitumor effector cells, which induced T cell infiltration and activation of in the brain tumors. In preclinical murine glioma models, B-LNP therapy significantly potentiated the antitumor effects of radiotherapy, promoted brain tumor regression, and induced immunological memory against gliomas. The nano37 therapy was efficacious through both intra-tumoral and systemic delivery routes. In summary, our study shows a unique nanotechnology-based approach that hijacks multiple immune checkpoints to boost potent and long-lasting antitumor immunity against GBM.

However, MSCs demonstrate significant functional heterogeneity in terms of their immunomodulatory function because of differences in MSC donor/tissue source, as well as non-standardized manufacturing approaches. As MSC metabolism plays a critical role in their ability to expand to therapeutic numbers ex vivo, we comprehensively profiled intracellular and extracellular metabolites throughout the expansion process to identify predictors of MSC immunomodulatory function (T cell modulation and indoleamine-2,3-dehydrogenase (IDO) activity). Here, we profiled media metabolites in a non-destructive manner through daily sampling and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), as well as MSC intracellular metabolites at the end of expansion using mass spectrometry (MS). Using a robust consensus machine learning approach, we were able to identify panels of metabolites predictive of MSC immunomodulatory function for 10 independent MSC lines.

In this study, we identify disordered cardiac retinol metabolism in type 2 diabetic male mice and patients characterized by retinol overload, all-trans retinoic acid deficiency. By supplementing type 2 diabetic male mice with retinol or all-trans retinoic acid, we demonstrate that both cardiac retinol overload and all-trans retinoic acid deficiency promote diabetic cardiomyopathy. Mechanistically, by constructing cardiomyocyte-specific conditional retinol dehydrogenase 10-knockout male mice and overexpressing retinol dehydrogenase 10 in male type 2 diabetic mice via adeno-associated virus, we verify that the reduction in cardiac retinol dehydrogenase 10 is the initiating factor for cardiac retinol metabolism disorder and results in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, we suggest that the reduction of cardiac retinol dehydrogenase 10 and its mediated disorder of cardiac retinol metabolism is a new mechanism underlying diabetic cardiomyopathy.

The present study aims to evaluate the potential effects of Lactobacillus plantarum JYLP-326 on test anxious college students. Sixty anxious students were enrolled and randomly allocated to the placebo group and the probiotic group, which were instructed to take placebo and JYLP-326 products twice per day for three weeks, respectively. Thirty unanxious students with no treatments were assigned to a regular control group. The anxiety, depression, and insomnia questionnaires were used to measure students’ mental states at the baseline and the end of this study. 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics were performed to analyze the changes in the gut microbiota and fecal metabolism. The questionnaire results suggested that JYLP-326 administration could relieve the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in test anxious students. The gut microbiomes of the placebo group showed a significantly greater a diversity index than the control group (p < 0.05). An increased abundance of Bacteroides and Roseburia was observed in the placebo group, and the relative abundance of Prevotella and Bifidobacterium decreased. Whereas JYLP-326 administration could partly restore the disturbed gut microbiota. Additionally, test anxiety was correlation with disordered fecal metabolomics such as a higher Ethyl sulfate and a lower Cyclohexylamine, which could be reversed after taking JYLP-326. Furthermore, the changed microbiota and fecal metabolites were significantly associated with anxiety-related symptoms. These results indicated that the intervention of L. plantarum JYLP-326 could be an effective strategy to alleviate anxiety, depression and insomnia in test anxious college students.

Here, we demonstrate that exposure of mice to the high ambient temperature of 36 °C increase host resistance to viral pathogens including influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). High heat-exposed mice increase basal body temperature over 38 °C to enable more bile acids production in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. The gut microbiota-derived deoxycholic acid (DCA) and its plasma membrane-bound receptor Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) signaling increase host resistance to influenza virus infection by suppressing virus replication and neutrophil-dependent tissue damage. Furthermore, the DCA and its nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist protect Syrian hamster from lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, we demonstrate that certain bile acids are reduced in the plasma of COVID-19 patients who developed moderate I/II disease compared with minor illness group. These findings uncover an unexpected mechanism by which virus-induced high fever increases host resistance to influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 in a gut microbiota-dependent manner.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001601	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8RH99			The effect of prions on cellular metabolism: The metabolic impact of the [RNQ+] prion and the native role of Rnq1p	Within the field of amyloid and prion disease there is a need for a more comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of disease biology. In order to facilitate the progression treatment and underpin comprehension of toxicity, fundamental understanding of the disruption to normal cellular biochemistry and trafficking is needed. Here, by removing the complex biochemistry of the brain, we have utilised known prion forming strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae carrying different conformational variants of the Rnq1p to obtain Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolic profiles and identify key perturbations of prion presence. These studies reveal that prion containing [RNQ+] cells display a significant reduction in amino acid biosynthesis and distinct perturbations in sphingolipid metabolism, with significant downregulation in metabolites within these pathways. Moreover, that native Rnq1p downregulates ubiquinone biosynthesis pathways within cells, suggesting that Rnq1p may play a lipid/mevalonate-based cytoprotective role as a regulator of ubiquinone production. These findings contribute to the understanding of how prion proteins interact in vivo in both their prion and non-prion confirmations and indicate potential targets for the mitigation of these effects. . We demonstrate specific sphingolipid centred metabolic disruptions due to prion presence and give insight into a potential cytoprotective role of the native Rnq1 protein. This provides evidence of metabolic similarities between yeast and mammalian cells as a consequence of prion presence and establishes the application of metabolomics as a tool to investigate prion/amyloid-based phenomena.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001602	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8MQ60			Impact of in-utero exposures to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances on the human fetal liver metabolome	Background Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are classed as Endocrine Disrupting Compounds (EDCs) but continue to be used in many products. This includes firefighting foams, flame retardants, utensil coatings and waterproofing of food packaging. PFAS exposure aberrantly modulates lipid, metabolite and bile acid (BA) levels, increasing susceptibility to onset and severity of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). To date, most studies in humans have focused on PFAS-exposure effects in adults. In this study we now demonstrate that PFAS are present in the human fetal liver and that they have metabolic consequences for the human fetus. Methods Human fetal livers from elective termination of pregnancies between 11-19 weeks of gestation (n = 78) were analysed by both targeted and untargeted metabolomic analyses of lipids, polar metabolites, BAs and PFAS. Stringent bioinformatic and statistical methods were applied to this data to generate a network of interacting molecules. Findings Metabolites associated with PFAS were identified in the fetal liver and these varied with gestational age . Conjugated BAs were markedly positively associated with fetal age. Several amino acids, fatty acids and sugar derivatives in fetal livers were inversely associated with PFAS exposure, while the BA glycolithocholic acid (GLCA) was markedly positively associated with all quantified PFAS. Furthermore, 7a-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), a marker of BA synthesis rate, was strongly positively associated with PFAS levels and was detectable as early as gestational week 12. Interpretation The data show direct evidence for in-utero effects of PFAS exposure on specific key hepatic products. Our results provide evidence that PFAS exposure, with potential future consequences, manifests in the human fetus as early as the first trimester of gestation. Furthermore, the profiles of metabolic changes resemble those observed in perinatal PFAS exposures. Such exposures are already linked with susceptibility, initiation, progression and/or exacerbation of a wide range of metabolic diseases.

This leads to the hypothesis that there are dietary constituents capable of inhibiting CYP1A1/1B1 increasing the half-live of potent AHR ligands. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of urolithin A (UroA) to act at CYP1A1/1B1 substrates leading to enhanced AHR activity in vivo.

The discovery of prenatal and neonatal molecular biomarkers has the potential to yield insights into autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and facilitate early diagnosis. We characterized metabolomic profiles in ASD using plasma samples collected in the Norwegian Autism Birth Cohort from mothers at weeks 17-21 gestation (maternal mid-gestation, MMG, n=408) and from children on the day of birth (cord blood, CB, n=418). We analyzed associations using sex-stratified adjusted logistic regression models with Bayesian analyses. Chemical enrichment analyses (ChemRICH) were performed to determine altered chemical clusters. We also employed machine learning algorithms to assess the utility of metabolomics as ASD biomarkers. We identified ASD associations with a variety of chemical compounds including arachidonic acid, glutamate, and glutamine, and metabolite clusters including hydroxy eicospentaenoic acids, phosphatidylcholines, and ceramides in MMG and CB plasma that are consistent with inflammation, disruption of membrane integrity, and impaired neurotransmission and neurotoxicity. Girls with ASD have disruption of ether/non-ether phospholipid balance in the MMG plasma that is similar to that found in other neurodevelopmental disorders. ASD boys in the CB analyses had the highest number of dysregulated chemical clusters. Machine learning classifiers distinguished ASD cases from controls with AUC values ranging from 0.710 to 0.853. Predictive performance was better in CB analyses than in MMG. These findings may provide new insights into the sex-specific differences in ASD and have implications for discovery of biomarkers that may enable early diagnosis and intervention.

The bispecific aPD1-IL2v is a PD-1-targeted IL-2 variant (IL2v) immunocytokine with engineered IL-2 cis-targeted to PD-1 and abolished IL2Ra binding, which enhances tumor-antigen specific T cell activation while reducing regulatory T cell (Treg) suppression. Using aPD1-IL2v in orthotopic PDAC KPC-driven tumor models, we show marked improvement in local and metastatic survival along with profound increase in tumor-infiltrating polyfunctional CD8+ T cell subsets with a transcriptionally and metabolically active phenotype, and preferential activation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. In combination with single dose RT, aPD1-IL2v treatment results in a robust, durable expansion of polyfunctional CD8+ T cells, T cell stemness, tumor-specific memory immune response, natural killer (NK) cell activation, and decreased Tregs. These data show that aPD1-IL2v leads to profound local and distant response in PDAC.

We establish that six tryptophan metabolites are essentially not CYP1A1 substrates and the level of these metabolite in mouse serum are not affected by a lack of CYP1A1 or any other Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) dependent metabolic pathway expression in vivo.

The pathogenesis likely involves genetic and environmental alterations. We hypothesized that a disrupted gut microbiota contributes to AN pathology. In analyses comparing 70 AN with 77 healthy females, we found multiple taxa, functional modules, structural variants and growth rates of bacterial gut microbiota, and viral gut microbiota that were altered in AN with parts of these perturbations linked to estimates of eating behavior and mental health. In silico, causal inference analyses implied bacterial metabolites mediated parts of the impact of altered gut microbiota on AN behavior, and in vivo, fecal microbiota transplantation from AN cases to germ-free mice induced a lower body weight and hypothalamic and adipose tissue gene expressions related to aberrant energy metabolism and eating and mental behavior.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001611	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8G12B			Study of environmental toxicants and gut microbiome in relation to obesity and insulin resistance	Background & Aims: Environmental toxicants (ETs) associate with various adverse health outcomes. Here, we hypothesized that exposures to ETs are associated with obesity and insulin resistance via a dysbiotic gut microbiota and derived alterations in microbiome-mediated bile acid (BA) synthesis. Methods: Serum BAs, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and additional twenty-seven ETs were measured by mass spectrometry in 264 Danes (121 women and 143 men, age 56.6 ± 7.3 years, BMI 29.7 ± 6.0 kg/m2). Bacterial species were identified based on whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing of DNA extracted from purified stool samples. Personalized genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) of gut microbial communities were developed to elucidate regulation of BA pathways. Subsequently, we compared findings in the human study with metabolic implications of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure in a PPAR?-humanized murine model. Results: Fasting serum concentrations of twelve ETs associated directly with measures of obesity and insulin resistance. Several bacterial species including Dorea longicatena, Dorea formicigenerans, Subdoligranulum spp., Veillonella spp., and Roseburia intestinalis associated positively and in a sex-dimorphic manner, particularly in women, with high exposure to ETs. Moreover, high serum concentrations of ETs were linked with higher fasting serum levels of microbiome-synthesized secondary BAs such as lithocholic acid (LCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). These findings were substantiated by the outcome of a murine exposure study. Conclusion: Serum concentrations of ETs, particularly in women, were associated with an altered gut microbiome-mediated secondary BA biosynthesis, linked with obesity and insulin resistance.

Amino acid supplementation reduces retinal neovascularization in mice. Little is known about amino acid contribution to Phase I ROP. Significant changes in retinal amino acids (including most decreased L-leucine, L-isoleucine and L-valine) were found in mice modeling hyperglycemia-associated Phase I ROP, and parenteral (i.p.) L-isoleucine suppressed physiological retinal vascularization. In premature infants, severe ROP was associated with a higher mean intake of parenteral versus enteral amino acids in the first two weeks of life after adjustment for treatment group, gestational age at birth, birth weight and sex. The number of days with parenteral amino acids support independently predicted severe ROP. Further understanding and modulating amino acids may help improve nutritional intervention and prevent Phase I ROP

Accordingly, a thorough understanding of biological characteristics associated with high-dose radiation is essential for revealing the mechanisms underlying the varied biological processes following high dose radiation and the development of novel potent radioprotective agents. In present study, plasma metabolic characteristics were investigated from patients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation following high-dose TBI pretreatment utilizing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The most potential panel of four metabolic markers for radiation injury was selected and the metabolic disorders involved were explored. The metabolic disorders implied the dysregulation of gut microflora, shift of energy supply from aerobic respiration to ketogenesis, protein synthesis and metabolism in response to TBI. Although similar metabolic alternation patterns exist between male and female following high-dose irradiation, specific changes are observed in either male or female patients. These findings provide valuable information for further selecting biomarkers, clues of pathogenic mechanisms involved in high-dose radiation exposure.

Here we visualized FA transfer by ECs using click chemistry. Apical FA interaction with EC CD36 induces actin reorganization, caveolin-1 tyrosine 14 (Cav-1Y14) phosphorylation, and ceramide generation in caveolae, culminating in caveolae internalization into FA/CD36/ceramide vesicles that are secreted basolaterally as small extracellular vesicles, sEVs (exosomes). In transwells, ECs expressing fluorescent CD63 (exosomal marker) transfer FAs to underlying myotubes in CD63-labeled sEVs. In vivo FA-CD63-CD36 transfer from ECs to muscle is shown using a mouse with EC-specific expression of emGFP-CD63. CD36 depletion, actin-binding latrunculin-B, Src inhibition, Cav-1Y14 mutation, and membrane neutral sphingomyelinase inhibition by GW4869 helped map the FA-sEV pathway. Injecting GW4869 to mice reduced muscle FA uptake, raised plasma FAs and lowered glucose, mimicking prominent Cd36-/- phenotypes. The FA-sEV pathway we describe contributes to crosstalk between ECs and underlying cells and links regulation of membrane ceramide to blood FAs.

However, the role of glycolytic metabolism in retinal morphogenesis remains unknown. Here we report that aerobic glycolysis is necessary for the early stages of retinal development. Taking advantage of an unbiased approach that combines the use of eye organoids and single-cell RNA sequencing we identified specific glucose transporters and glycolytic genes in retinal progenitors. Next, we determined that the optic vesicle territory of mouse embryos displays elevated levels of glycolytic activity. At the functional level, we found that removal of Glut1 (also known as Slc2a1) and Lactate dehydrogenase A (Ldha) gene activity from developing retinal progenitors arrested eye morphogenesis. Surprisingly, we uncovered that lactate-mediated upregulation of key eye-field transcription factors was controlled by the epigenetic modification of histone H3 acetylation through histone deacetylase (Hdac) activity. Our results identify a novel bioenergetic independent role of lactate as a signaling molecule necessary for mammalian eye morphogenesis.

The prevalent and disease-linked Actinobacterium Eggerthella lenta performs several unusual chemical transformations, but it does not metabolize sugars and its core growth strategy remains unclear. To obtain a comprehensive view of the metabolic network of E. lenta, we generated several complementary resources: defined culture media, metabolomics profiles of strain isolates, and a curated genome-scale metabolic reconstruction. Stable isotope-resolved metabolomics revealed that E. lenta uses acetate as a key carbon source while catabolizing arginine to generate ATP, traits which could be recapitulated in silico by our updated metabolic model. We compared these in vitro findings with metabolite shifts observed in E. lenta-colonized gnotobiotic mice, identifying shared signatures across environments and highlighting catabolism of the host signaling metabolite agmatine as an alternative energy pathway. Together, our results elucidate a distinctive metabolic niche filled by E. lenta in the gut ecosystem.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001621	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85M6X			Enhanced niche colonization and competition during bacterial adaptation to a fungus	Bacterial-fungal interactions (BFIs) influence microbial community performance of most ecosystems and elicit specific microbial behaviors, including the stimulation of specialized metabolite production. Using a simple BFI system encompassing the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and the black mold fungus Aspergillus niger, we established a co-culture experimental evolution method to investigate bacterial adaptation to the presence of a fungus. In the evolving populations, B. subtilis was rapidly selected for enhanced production of the lipopeptide surfactin and accelerated surface spreading that led to an inhibition of fungal expansion and environment acidification. These phenotypes were explained by specific mutations in the DegS-DegU two-component system. In the presence of surfactin, the fungal hyphae exhibited bulged cells with delocalized secretory vesicles and RlmA-dependent cell wall stress induction. Increased surfactin production generally enhances the competitive success of the bacterium against various Aspergillus species that likely explains the primary adaption path in the presence of A. niger.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001623	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8X42D			Wide-Coverage Serum Metabolomic Profiling Reveals a Comprehensive Lipidome Signature of Ovarian Cancer.	Distinguishing ovarian cancer (OC) from other benign or cancerous gynecological malignancies remains a critical unmet medical need with significant implications on patient survival. Substantially better results are observed when women with OC are correctly diagnosed and ensured the right treatment. However, non-specific symptoms along with our lack of understanding of OC pathogenesis hinder its diagnosis, consequently leading to a very low survival rate. Accumulating evidence suggests the link between OC and deregulated lipid metabolism. Most studies, however, are limited by small sample sizes and metabolite coverage, thereby constraining the robustness of the results. Here, we performed a comprehensive serum lipidome profiling of OC and various other gynecological malignancies (non-OC). A relatively large patient cohort with 208 OC and 137 non-OC patients, including 93 OC patients with early-stage OC, was recruited from two independent clinical sites in South Korea. Samples were analyzed with high-coverage liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry, providing extensive lipidome coverage with 994 successfully annotated lipid features. Lipidome differences between OC and other gynecological malignancies were investigated via statistical and machine learning approaches. Our data suggest that lipidome alterations unique to OC can be detected as early as when the cancer is localized, and those changes amplify as the diseases progresses. Comparison of the relative lipid abundances revealed specific patterns based on lipid class with most lipid classes showing decreased abundance in ovarian cancer. This study provides a systemic analysis of lipidome alterations in OC, emphasizing the potential of circulating lipids as a complementary class of blood-based biomarkers for OC diagnosis.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001624	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8S99J			LBP resists hepatic oxidative stress by regulating LD homeostasis	Stress elevates the formation of ROS and lipid peroxidation, which induce lipid droplets (LDs) accumulation and adverse metabolic disturbance. Here, we explored the novel role of Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) as an anti-oxidant, which can capture unsaturated triglyceride (TG) into LDs to avoid lipid peroxidation. Oxidative stress upregulates LBP level and promotes LDs growth via the LBP/TG phase transition. Upon N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) elimination of ROS, LBP is exported from LD along with PRDX4, resulting in an increase in phospholipid synthesis. Chronic stress causes LBP upregulation and leads to obesity, which can be rescued by NAC treatment in vivo. These results support that LBP maintains homeostasis by coupling lipid metabolism and redox signal, which provides insights into redox medicine that mitigate stress-induced metabolic dysfunction.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001626	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8HT4B			In situ microwave fixation provides an instantaneous snapshot of the brain metabolome	The brain metabolome directly connects to brain physiology and neuronal function. Brain glucose metabolism is highly heterogeneous among brain regions and continues postmortem. Therefore, challenges remain to capture an accurate snapshot of the physiological brain metabolome in healthy and diseased rodent models. To overcome this barrier, we employed high-power focused microwave for the simultaneous euthanasia and fixation of mouse brain tissue to preserve metabolite pools prior to surgical removal and dissection of brain regions. We demonstrate exhaustion of glycogen and glucose and an increase in lactate production during conventional rapid brain resection prior to preservation by liquid nitrogen that is not observed with microwave fixation. Next, microwave fixation was employed to define the impact of brain glucose metabolism in the mouse model of streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes. Using both total pool and isotope tracing analyses, we identified global glucose hypometabolism in multiple regions of the mouse brain, evidenced by reduced 13C enrichment into glycogen, glycolysis, and the TCA cycle. Reduced glucose metabolism correlated with a marked decrease in GLUT2 expression and several metabolic enzymes in unique brain regions. In conclusion, our study supports the incorporation of microwave fixation to study terminal brain metabolism in rodent models.

Therefore, knowledge of microenvironmental nutrient levels and how cancer cells cope with such nutrition is critical to understand the metabolism underpinning cancer cell biology. Previously, we performed quantitative metabolomics of the interstitial fluid (the local perfusate) of murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors to comprehensively characterize nutrient availability in the microenvironment of these tumors (Sullivan et al., 2019a). Here, we develop Tumor Interstitial Fluid Medium (TIFM), a cell culture medium that contains nutrient levels representative of the PDAC microenvironment, enabling study of PDAC metabolism under physiological nutrition. We show that PDAC cells cultured in TIFM, compared to standard laboratory models, adopt a cellular state more similar to PDAC cells in tumors. Further, using the TIFM model we identified arginine biosynthesis as a metabolic adaptation PDAC cells engage to cope with microenvironmental arginine starvation driven by myeloid cells in PDAC tumors. Altogether, these data show that nutrient availability in tumors is an important determinant of cancer cell metabolism and behavior, and cell culture models that incorporate physiological nutrient availability have improved fidelity and enable the discovery of novel cancer metabolic phenotypes.

The pathobiology of the interplay between BMI and HDP is not fully understood and represents the focus of this investigation. BMI and 1st-trimester serum samples were obtained from the Global Alliance to Prevent Prematurity and Stillbirth repository for 154 women (105 without HDP and 49 with HDP). Metabotyping was conducted using ultra-high-performance liquid-chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC HR-MS). Regression models were used to determine metabolites and pathway perturbations associated with BMI in women with and without HDP, and to determine metabolites and pathway perturbations associated with HDP for women in categories of obese, overweight, and normal weight based on the 1st trimester BMI. This study will lay the groundwork for larger studies of predictive markers and biological pathways leading to infant morbidity and mortality.

Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has the potential to identify metabolic patterns within the tumor ecosystem and surrounding tissues, but conventional workflows have not yet fully integrated the breadth of experimental techniques in metabolomics. Here, we combine MSI, stable isotope labeling, and a spatial variant of Isotopologue Spectral Analysis to map distributions of metabolite abundances, nutrient contributions, and metabolic turnover fluxes across the brains of mice harboring GL261 glioma, a widely used model for glioblastoma. When integrated with MSI, the combination of ion mobility, Desorption Electrospray Ionization, and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption revealed disruption in multiple anabolic pathways. De novo fatty acid synthesis flux was determined to be increased by approximately 3-fold in glioma relative to surrounding healthy tissue. Fatty acid elongation flux was elevated even higher at 8-fold and highlights the importance of elongase activity in glioma. The fluxes we examined were uniformly increased throughout the entire tumor region, revealing a high degree of metabolic homogeneity in our model of glioblastoma.

Because of that, its outdoor production in extensive areas faces several concerns. Kong & Zheng (2014) evaluated the potential of producing purslane in a hydroponic system, generating approximately 5.75 kg of fresh matter per m2 per month, which might yield 57.5 tons/hectare/year if cultivated in a bimestrial regime. The high productivity of purslane, when grown in controlled-environment agriculture, can open many opportunities for the purslane industry, even in the context of biosaline agriculture. Building up a robust multi-omics database on the response of purslane to salt stress and the subsequent study of it via an MOI analysis can create the basis for a future system biology approach to decode the genetics behind its resistance to salinity stress. The present study is a second step in building a robust database on the morpho-physiological and molecular responses of Portulaca oleracea L. to salinity stress and its subsequent use in attempting to decode the genetics behind its resistance to this abiotic stress. After reporting on the characterization of the morpho-physiological responses of young purslane plants to such stress using a robust salinization protocol, here we report a study on adult purslane plants through the characterization of the untargeted metabolome and proteome profiles on the leaves and roots of this halophyte species submitted to very high salinity stress, and the consequent use of single- and multi-omics analysis strategies to study it.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001635	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8C42F			Microbial metabolomic responses to changes in temperature and salinity along the western Antarctic Peninsula.	Seasonal cycles within the marginal ice zones in polar regions include large shifts in temperature and salinity that strongly influence microbial abundance and physiology. However, the combined effects of concurrent temperature and salinity change on microbial community structure and biochemical composition during transitions between seawater and sea ice are not well understood. Coastal marine communities along the western Antarctic Peninsula were sampled and surface seawater was incubated at combinations of temperature and salinity mimicking the formation (cold, salty) and melting (warm, fresh) of sea ice to evaluate how these factors may shape community composition and particulate metabolite pools during seasonal transitions. Bacterial and algal community structures were tightly coupled to each other and distinct across sea-ice, seawater, and sea-ice-meltwater field samples, with unique metabolite profiles in each habitat. During short-term (approximately 10-day) incubations of seawater microbial communities under different temperature and salinity conditions, community compositions changed minimally while metabolite pools shifted greatly, strongly accumulating compatible solutes like proline and glycine betaine under cold and salty conditions. Lower salinities reduced total metabolite concentrations in particulate matter, which may indicate a release of metabolites into the labile dissolved organic matter pool. Low salinity also increased acylcarnitine concentrations in particulate matter, suggesting a potential for fatty acid degradation and reduced nutritional value at the base of the food web during freshening. Our findings have consequences for food web dynamics, microbial interactions, and carbon cycling as polar regions undergo rapid climate change.

Defects in SCs are associated with many PNS disorders including diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), a condition affecting millions of patients. We have developed a strategy for deriving SCs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) which recapitulate the molecular features of primary SCs and are capable of engrafting efficiently and producing myelin in vitro and in injured sciatic nerves in rats. We further established an hPSC-based model of DPN that revealed the selective vulnerability of human SCs to hyperglycemia-induced cytotoxicity. By high-throughput screening we found bupropion counteracts glucose-mediated cytotoxicity in SCs and normalizes glucose-induced transcriptional and metabolic abnormalities in SCs. Treatment of hyperglycemic mice with bupropion rescued sensory function, prevented SC death, and counteracted myelin damage in sciatic nerves. Our retrospective analysis of patient health records revealed that bupropion treatment was associated with a lower incidence of neuropathy among diabetic patients that receive antidepressant medications.

However, mechanisms underlying the MR-induced effect remain incompletely understood. Here, we show in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae that MR relays a signal of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) deprivation to adapt bioenergetic mitochondria to nitrogenic anabolism.In particular, decreases in cellular SAM constrain lipoate metabolism and protein lipoylation required for the operation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the mitochondria, leading to incomplete glucose oxidation with an exit of acetyl-CoA and alpha-ketoglutarate from the TCA cycle to the syntheses of amino acids, such as arginine and leucine. This mitochondrial SAM-induced response, namely mitoSIR, promotes cell fitness through the coordination of mitochondrial fuel metabolism with the nitrogenic synthesis of amino acids.

In the discovery of biomarkers in biological models, pathophysiological traits present a source of translatable metabolic products for the diagnosis of disease in humans. Part of the metabolome is represented by its volatile, gaseous fraction; the volatilome. Human volatile profiles, such as those found in breath, are able to diagnose disease, however accurate volatile biomarker discovery is required to target reliable biomarkers to develop new diagnostic tools. Using custom chambers to control oxygen levels and facilitate headspace sampling, the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line was exposed to hypoxia (1% oxygen) for 24 hours. The maintenance of hypoxic conditions in the system was successfully validated over this time period. Targeted and ununtargeted gas chromatography mass spectrometry approaches revealed four significantly altered volatile organic compounds when compared to control cells. Three compounds were actively consumed by cells: methyl chloride, acetone and n-Hexane. Cells under hypoxia also produced significant amounts of styrene. This work presents a novel methodology for identification of volatile metabolisms under controlled gas conditions with novel observations of volatile metabolisms by breast cancer cells.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001639	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8V41D			Metabolomic study on the chronic Toxoplasma gondii infection in mice.	Cachexia is a life-threatening disease characterized by chronic, inflammatory muscle wasting and systemic metabolic impairment. Despite its high prevalence, there are no efficacious therapies for cachexia. Mice chronically infected with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii represent a novel animal model recapitulating the chronic kinetics of cachexia. To understand how perturbations to metabolic tissue homeostasis influence circulating metabolite availability we used mass spectrometry analysis. Despite the significant reduction in circulating triacylglycerides, nonesterified fatty acids, and glycerol, sphingolipid long-chain bases and a subset of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) were significantly increased in the sera of mice with T. gondii infection-induced cachexia. In addition, the TCA cycle intermediates alpha-ketoglutarate, 2- hydroxyglutarate, succinate, fumarate, and malate were highly depleted in cachectic mouse sera.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001641	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8KM6N			Myeloperoxidase oxidants elicit distinct metabolomic responses in airway epithelial cells and reveal early cystic fibrosis disease risk factors	Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is released by neutrophils in inflamed tissues. MPO oxidizes chloride, bromide, and thiocyanate to produce hypochlorous acid (HOCl), hypobromous acid (HOBr), or hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN), respectively. These oxidants are toxic to pathogens, but they also react with host cells and may elicit redox signaling or cause collateral damage. Here, we investigated how equal dose-rate exposures of MPO-derived oxidants differentially impact the metabolome of human airway epithelial cells (AEC). AECs are important targets of oxidative stress in inflammatory lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in which neutrophils, MPO, and reactive oxygen species are increased compared to healthy individuals. HOSCN-exposed cells were viable after 24 h of continuous oxidant exposure, while HOBr and HOCl exposures were cytotoxic by 24 h. Untargeted metabolomics revealed MPO-derived oxidants caused distinct metabolic effects in AECs. HOCl and HOBr were more similar to each other than either was to HOSCN, and all differed from hydrogen peroxide. We noted methionine oxidation products, methionine sulfoxide and dehydromethionine, were significantly increased compared to controls only in HOCl- and HOBr-exposed cells. Furthermore, the presence of these metabolites in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 5 years-olds with CF (n=27) was associated with increased neutrophilic inflammation and bronchiectasis. This indicates that HOCl and/or HOBr are likely present in early CF airways and either contribute to disease progression or associate with a related pathophysiological process. We anticipate this oxidant exposure model can be used to identify additional novel metabolites which could serve as candidate biomarkers of MPO-driven inflammation in human disease.

Metabolomics is becoming important for identifying ARDS biology and distinguishing subtypes. The aim of this study is to identify metabolites distinguishing sepsis-induced ARDS patients from healthy controls using a targeted metabolomics approach, and to find out whether direct and indirect ARDS are metabolically distinct groups and confirm their metabolites and associated pathways. Targeted metabolomics was performed to explore metabolome changes between pARDS (pediatric ARDS) and eARDS.

GAL develops non-preventable life-threatening complications even with a reduced content of galactose and lactose patient’s diet. Thus, the underlying pathophysiology of long-term complications in GAL remains poorly understood. The current study used a metabolomics approach using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry to investigate the metabolomic changes in the dried blood spots of 15 patients with GAL and 39 healthy individuals. Compared to the control group, 2,819 metabolites underwent significant changes in patients with GAL. In all, 480 human endogenous metabolites were identified, of which 209 and 271 were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. PA (8:0/LTE4) and ganglioside GT1c (d18:0/20:0) metabolites showed the most significant difference between GAL and the healthy group, with an area under the curve of 1 and 0.995, respectively. Additionally, our findings showed novel potential biomarkers for GAL, such as 17-alpha-estradiol-3-glucuronide and 16-alpha-hydroxy DHEA 3-sulfatediphosphate. In conclusion, this metabolomics study deepened the understanding of the pathophysiology of GAL and presented metabolites that might serve as potential prognostic biomarkers to monitor the progression or support the clinical diagnosis of GAL.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001645	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M82M7C			Exploring the Impact of Oral Arabic Gum Consumption on Sphingolipid Metabolism and human metabolites in Chronic Kidney Disease: A Mass Spectrometry Analysis	Globally, the incidence of chronic kidney disease is increasing, raising serious concerns about its impact on public health. It also poses significant difficulty in finding novel early diagnostics, understanding biochemical pathways, monitoring patients, and prognosis. Any metabolite found in a biofluid, or tissue may act as a driver, signal, or both in the emergence or spread of the disease. As a result, metabolomics is a very useful strategy in this therapeutic setting. Broad metabolite coverage is essential since it strives to offer a representative image of a biological system. An untargeted metabolomics-based method was used in this cross-sectional study to identify metabolomic changes and their relationship to pathways in the Arabic gum patient group and control participants. Plasma samples were collected from 88 participants who met the inclusion criteria, of whom 43 control patients were treated with a placebo and 45 intervention patients were treated with Arabic gum. Highly sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to analyze the plasma samples (UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS). We investigated the effect of Arabic gum on individual metabolites using a two-tailed independent student t-test. The results showed that 31 out of 92 identified metabolites were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). L-Leucine and 5'-Methylthioadenosine were the significantly increased metabolites in the Arabic gum group. Conversely, triethylamine, D-limonene, 4-methylphenylacetic acid, and sphingosine levels were significantly lower in the Arabic gum group compared to the control. Arabic gum primarily affected multiple metabolic pathways, including glycine and serine, arginine and proline, valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation, phenylalanine and tyrosine, urea cycle, and sphingolipid. The results from this study provide insights into the potential diagnostic significance of different metabolites in chronic kidney disease and their impact on specific metabolic pathways. However, further research involving larger cohorts is necessary to validate the observed metabolite changes following Arabic gum intake and their diagnostic value for chronic kidney disease.

The sample cohort consisted of 60 drug-naïve patients and 30 control individuals. Untargeted lipidomics strategy using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry was employed to obtain the data, and univariate and multivariate statistical tools were applied to evaluate the results. Metabolic pathway networks were constructed and our results demonstrated alterations in different lipid pathways, such as glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and prostaglandins between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001647	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8T413			Ethnicity-Specific Differences in Ovarian Cancer Metabolic Signatures	Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Cancer cell metabolism plays a critical role in tumor growth and progression, and metabolic alterations in cancer cells have been implicated in treatment resistance. In this study, we performed metabolomic analysis using ovarian cancer cells derived from patients in the United States and Korea. Our results reveal significant ethnic-specific differences in the metabolic signatures of ovarian cancer cells, with differential regulation of metabolites derived from glycolytic pathways, lipid metabolism, and microbiome modified metabolites. These findings have important therapeutic implications, as differences in ovarian cancer metabolism between ethnic groups may influence treatment response and resistance. Targeting the unique metabolic signatures of ovarian cancer cells based on ethnic specificity may improve the effectiveness of precision medicine approaches in the treatment of ovarian cancer. This study highlights the potential for personalized and targeted therapeutic options based on the tumor metabolome and ethnic background of the patient. Overall, our results suggest that investigating ethnic-specific differences in cancer metabolism is critical for developing effective and personalized cancer therapies. The identification of unique metabolic signatures in ovarian cancer cells based on ethnic specificity provides a promising avenue for improving treatment outcomes and advancing the field of precision medicine in ovarian cancer.

Holstein cows (n = 104) had blood collected in the prepartum period (d-14 ± 6), at calving (d0), and at the day of metritis diagnosis (d7 ± 2). Cows with reddish or brownish, watery, and fetid discharge were diagnosed with metritis (n = 52). Cows with metritis were paired with herdmates without metritis (n = 52) based on DIM. The metabolome of plasma samples was evaluated using untargeted gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Univariate analyses included t-tests and fold change analyses. Metabolites with false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P = 0.10 on t-tests were used for partial least squares – discriminant analysis PLS-DA coupled with permutational analysis using 2,000 permutations. Metabolites with FDR adjusted P = 0.10 on t-tests were also used for enriched pathway analyses and identification of cellular processes. Cows that developed metritis had affected cellular processes associated with lower amino acid metabolism in the prepartum period, greater lipolysis, cell death, and oxidative stress at calving and at metritis diagnosis, and greater leukocyte activation at calving, but lower immune cell activation at metritis diagnosis. In summary, cows that developed metritis had plasma metabolomic changes associated with greater lipolysis, oxidative stress, and a dysregulated immune response which may predispose cows to metritis development.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001649	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8JQ50			Untargeted Metabolomics Identifies Biomarkers for MCADD Neonates in Dried Blood Spots	Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is the most common inherited mitochondrial metabolic disease of fatty acid ß-oxidation, especially in newborns. MCADD is clinically diagnosed using Newborn Bloodspot Screening (NBS) and genetic testing. Still, these methods have limitations, such as false negatives or positives in NBS and variants of uncertain significance in genetic testing. Thus, complementary diagnostic approaches for MCADD are needed. Recently, untargeted metabolomics has been proposed as a diagnostic approach for inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) due to its ability to detect a wide range of metabolic alterations. We performed untargeted metabolic profiling of dried blood spots (DBS) from MCADD newborns (n=14) and healthy controls (n=14) to discover potential metabolic biomarkers/pathways associated with MCADD. Extracted metabolites from DBS samples were analyzed using UPLC-QToF-MS for untargeted metabolomics analyses. Multivariate and univariate analyses were used to analyze the metabolomics data, and pathway and biomarker analyses were also performed on the significantly endogenous identified metabolites. MCADD newborns had 1034 significantly dysregulated metabolites compared to healthy newborns (Moderated t-test, no correction, p-value = 0.05, FC 1.5). 23 endogenous metabolites were upregulated, while 84 endogenous metabolites were downregulated. Pathway analyses showed phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis as the most affected pathway. Potential metabolic biomarkers for MCADD were PGP (a21:0/PG/F1alpha) and glutathione with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.949 and 0.898, respectively. PGP (a21:0/PG/F1alpha) was the only oxidized lipid in the top-15 biomarker list with the highest p-value and FC. Also, glutathione was chosen to indicate oxidative stress events that could happen during fatty acid oxidation defects. Our findings suggest that MCADD newborns may have oxidative stress events as signs of the disease. However, further validations of these biomarkers are needed in future studies to ensure their accuracy and reliability as complementary markers with established MCADD markers for clinical diagnosis.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001652	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85D90			Hydroxylated acylcarnitines as potential biomarkers for VLCADD newborn patients in Saudi Arabia	Very long acylcarnitine dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) is an inherited metabolic disorder related to fatty acid ß-oxidation. It is characterized by genetic mutations in ACADVL gene and accumulations of acylcarnitines. VLCADD can be developed in the neonatal period or during adulthood. Certain diagnostic approaches are used to confirm the diagnosis of VLCADD including genetic sequencing and newborn bloodspot screening (NBS). The last two approaches have shown some limitations such as VUS with genetic sequencing and false positive or negative results in NBS. Therefore, there are demands for additional diagnostic tools for VLCADD. Since VLCADD is associated with disrupted metabolism, untargeted metabolomics, which is an analytical technique used to detect a large-scale profiling of metabolites in biological samples, could be a useful tool for diagnosis. We hypothesized that VLCADD newborns patients may exhibit a unique metabolic profile and biomarkers compared to healthy newborns. Untargeted metabolomics approach was conducted using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to measure the global metabolites in DBS cards collected from VLCADD newborns (n=15) and healthy controls (n=15). Metabolite extraction was performed and followed by LC-MS analysis. Multivariate and univariate analyses were used to analyze the metabolomics data, and pathway and biomarker analyses were also performed on the significantly endogenous identified metabolites. A moderate T-test was used for statistical analysis? with no correction, and the cutoff was (p-value = 0.05 and Fold Change 1.5). VLCADD newborns had 2012 significantly dysregulated metabolites compared to healthy newborns. 58 endogenous metabolites were upregulated while 148 endogenous metabolites were downregulated. Pathway analyses showed phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis as the most affected pathway. Potential metabolic biomarker for VLCADD was 3,4-dihydroxytetradecanoylcarnitine with an area under the curve (AUC) of 1, was in the top-15 biomarker list with the highest p-value and FC, suggesting its high possibility to be used for diagnosis. However, validation experiments of the biomarker is needed in following-up studies to ensure its accuracy and reliability to be used as a VLCADD marker in the clinical practice. ?

Recently, abnormal polyol metabolism has also been implicated in phosphomannomutase 2-congenital disorder of glycosylation (PMM2-CDG), and epalrestat, an AR inhibitor, proposed as a potential therapy for this disorder. Given that the PMM enzyme is not closely connected to polyol metabolism, and, unlike in diabetes, PMM2-CDG does not present with hyperglycemia in blood, the increased polyol production, and the therapeutic mechanism of epalrestat in PMM2-CDG remained largely elusive. PMM2-CDG is caused by deficiency of the PMM enzyme and results in a depletion of mannose-1-P and guanosine diphosphate mannose (GDP-mannose), which is essential for glycosylation. Here, we show that apart from glycosylation abnormalities, PMM2 deficiency also leads to changes in intracellular glucose flux, which results in an increase in intracellular polyols. Targeting AR with epalrestat decreases polyol levels and increases GDP-mannose in vivo in pmm2 mutant zebrafish.

Inherited VLCAD deficiency (VLCADD) predisposes to neonatal arrhythmias whose pathophysiology is still not understood. We hypothesized that VLCADD results in global disruption of cardiac complex lipid homeostasis, which may set conditions predisposing to arrhythmia. To test this, we assessed the cardiac lipidome and related molecular markers in seven-month-old VLCAD-/- mice, which mimic to some extent the human cardiac phenotype. Mice were sacrificed in the fed or fasted state after receiving for two weeks a chow or a high-fat diet (HFD), the latter condition being known to worsen symptoms in human VLCADD. Compared to their littermate counterparts, HFD/fasted VLCAD-/- mouse hearts displayed the following lipid alterations: (1) Lower LC, but higher VLC-acylcarnitines accumulation, (2) higher levels of arachidonic acid (AA) and lower docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) contents in glycerophospholipids (GPLs), as well as (3) corresponding changes in pro-arrhythmogenic AA-derived isoprostanes and thromboxane B2 (higher), and anti-arrythmogenic DHA-derived neuroprostanes (lower). These changes were associated with remodeling in the expression of gene or protein markers of (1) PL remodeling: higher calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 and lysophosphatidylcholine-acyltransferase 2, (2) calcium handling perturbations: higher SERCA2a and phospholamban, but lower RyR2, and (3) endoplasmic reticulum stress: higher CHOP and GRP78. Altogether, these results highlight global lipid dyshomeostasis beyond FAO in VLCAD-/- mouse hearts, which may set conditions predisposing the hearts to calcium mishandling and endoplasmic reticulum stress and thereby may contribute to the pathogenesis of arrhythmias in VLCADD in mice as well as in humans.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001658	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8CX2C			DRMY1 promotes robust morphogenesis by sustaining translation of a hormone signaling protein	Robustness is the invariant development of phenotype despite environmental changes and genetic perturbations. In the Arabidopsis flower bud, four sepals initiate at robust positions and times and grow to equal size to enclose and protect the inner floral organs. We previously characterized the mutant development related myb-like1 (drmy1), where 3-5 sepals initiate at irregular positions and variable times and grow to different sizes, compromising their protective function. The molecular mechanism underlying this loss of robustness was unclear. Here, we show that drmy1 has reduced TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) activity, ribosomal content, and translation. Translation reduction decreases the protein level of ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR7 (ARR7), a rapidly synthesized and degraded cytokinin signaling inhibitor. The resultant upregulation of cytokinin signaling disrupts the robust positioning of auxin signaling, causing variable sepal initiation. Our work shows that the homeostasis of translation, a ubiquitous cellular process, is crucial for the robust spatiotemporal patterning of organogenesis.

Loss of PTEN activated AKT kinase to inhibit GSK3beta, increasing NRF2 along with transcription of one of its known target genes encoding xCT. Elevated xCT in Pten-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts increased the flux of cystine transport and the synthesis of glutathione, which enhanced the steady state levels of these metabolites. A pan cancer analysis revealed that loss of PTEN shows evidence of increased xCT and PTEN mutant cells were found to be resistant to ferroptosis as a consequence of elevated xCT. These findings suggest that selection of PTEN mutation during tumor development may be due to its ability to confer resistance to ferroptosis in the setting of metabolic stress that occurs during tumor initiation and progression.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001662	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8VX33			Hydroxyproline Modulates Adaptive PD-L1 Expression and Autophagy	The immune checkpoint protein PD-L1 plays critical roles in both immune system homeostasis and tumor progression. Impaired PD-1/PD-L1 function promotes autoimmunity and PD-L1 expression within tumors promotes immune evasion. If and how changes in metabolism or defined metabolites regulate PD-L1 expression is not fully understood. Here, using a metabolomics activity screening-based approach, we have determined that hydroxyproline (Hyp) significantly and directly enhances adaptive (i.e., IFN-? induced) PD-L1 expression in multiple relevant myeloid and cancer cell types. Mechanistic studies reveal that Hyp acts as an inhibitor of IFN-?-induced autophagic flux, which allows it to regulate this negative feedback mechanism, thereby contributing to its overall effect on PD-L1 expression. Due to its prevalence in fibrotic tumors, these findings suggest that hydroxyproline could contribute to the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and that Hyp metabolism could be targeted to pharmacologically control PD-L1 expression for the treatment of cancer or autoimmune diseases.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001663	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8R72W			Alanine supplementation exploits glutamine dependency induced by SMARCA4/2-loss	SMARCA4 (BRG1) and SMARCA2 (BRM) are the two paralogous ATPases of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes frequently inactivated in cancers.we uncover that SMARCA4/2-loss represses expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1, causing reduced glucose uptake and glycolysis accompanied with increased dependency on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS); adapting to this, these SMARCA4/2-deficient cells rely on elevated SLC38A2, an amino acid transporter, to increase glutamine import for fueling OXPHOS. Consequently, SMARCA4/2-deficient cells and tumors are highly sensitive to inhibitors targeting OXPHOS or glutamine metabolism. Furthermore, supplementation of alanine, also imported by SLC38A2, restricts glutamine uptake through competition and selectively induces death in SMARCA4/2-deficient cancer cells. At a clinically relevant dose, alanine supplementation synergizes with OXPHOS inhibition or conventional chemotherapy eliciting marked antitumor activity in patient-derived xenografts. Our findings reveal multiple druggable vulnerabilities of SMARCA4/2-loss exploiting a GLUT1/SLC38A2-mediated metabolic shift. Particularly, unlike dietary deprivation approaches, alanine supplementation can be readily applied to current regimens for better treatment of these aggressive cancers.

To determine if Zn has anticancer activity in established ESCC, we performed a 33-day Zn treatment study in 31 ESCC-bearing ZD male rats with 85% ESCC incidence (designated Zn-untreated) that were generated in a 20-wk Zn deficiency-promoted, N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA)-induced ESCC experiment (3). The ESCC-bearing Zn-untreated male rats demonstrated oncogenic miR-31 and -21 upregulation (3, 4) and human ESCC-associated metabolic changes (3), with decreased levels of glycolytic intermediates and increased levels of anabolic/biosynthetic intermediates, changes pointing to a classic cancer cell remodeling of energy and nucleoside metabolism (5). The 31 ESCC-bearing Zn-untreated rats were randomized into two groups, viz Zn-untreated (n = 10) and Zn-treated (n = 21). While Zn-untreated rats continued on ZD diet and deionized water, Zn-treated rats were given deionized water supplemented with 25 ppm Zn as Zn gluconate (2) and paired-fed a ZS diet to Zn-untreated rats. This study was concluded after 33 days of Zn medication. We found that Zn therapy reduced ESCC incidence from 90 to 43%, a drop of 47%. We then determined if Zn intervention, that reduced ESCC incidence, would induce metabolic changes to reverse the ESCC-associated metabolome (3).

Metabolomics studies have identified biomarkers that could improve T2D diagnosis and follow-up. However, no studies have characterized the metabolome of people from Sub-Saharan Africa. Plasma samples from Senegalese individuals with T2D (n=31) or without T2D (n=34) were compared using measures of oxidative stress damage and plasma antioxidant enzyme activity, and mass-spectrometry-based lipidomics and metabolomics analyses. Results showed that glucose, lactate, and TCA metabolites (fumarate, malate, and succinate) were increased in the T2D group, suggesting alterations in glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Several amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine, and tryptophan) and long-to very-long-chain fatty acids were higher in the T2D group. Finally, elevated levels of ketone bodies and acylcarnitines were observed along with increased levels of oxidative stress damage and anti-oxidant activity. In conclusion, the T2D group exhibited modifications in metabolites previously shown to be associated with T2D risk in populations from other areas of the world. Future studies should seek to test whether these metabolites could be used as predictors for T2D-related complications in people from Sub-Saharan Africa.

In addition, prior studies of mice harboring large, overlapping chromosomal deletions implicated Atp10A in the development of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Here, we generated gene-specific Atp10A knockout mice and show that Atp10A-/- mice fed a high-fat diet did not gain excess weight relative to wild-type littermates. However, Atp10A-/- mice displayed female-specific dyslipidemia characterized by elevated plasma triglycerides, free fatty acids and cholesterol, as well as altered VLDL and HDL properties. We also observed increased circulating levels of several sphingolipid species along with reduced levels of eicosanoids and bile acids. The Atp10A-/- mice also displayed hepatic insulin resistance without perturbations to whole-body glucose homeostasis. Thus, ATP10A has a sex-specific role in regulating plasma lipid composition and maintaining hepatic liver insulin sensitivity in mice.

Microgravity and prolonged periods of inactivity cause a variety of diseases, including skeletal muscle mass loss and weakening as well as cardiovascular deconditioning. The primary causes of the inadequate preventative measures for these deconditionings are the lack of biomarkers and unknown underlying mechanisms of cardiovascular and skeletal muscle deconditioning in these conditions. Here, we used a hindlimb unloading (HU) mouse model that replicates astronauts in space and bedridden patients to first evaluate cardiovascular and skeletal muscle performance. Serum samples from these mice were used to identify new biomarkers using metabolomic and proteomic approaches. Three weeks of unloading resulted in alterations in cardiovascular system function in C57/Bl6 mice, as measured by changes in mean arterial pressure and heart weight. Unloading for three weeks also altered skeletal muscle function, resulting in a decrease of grip strength in HU mice, as well as skeletal muscle atrophy, as shown by a drop in muscle mass. A two-week recovery time from the unloading condition partially reversed these alterations, stressing the importance of the recovery process.

Here, we observed that systemic host inflammation induced in mice by an innate immune stimulus, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or by ongoing acute Plasmodium infection, slowed the progression of a single cohort of parasites from one generation of RBC to the next. Importantly, plasma from LPS-conditioned or acutely-infected mice directly inhibited parasite maturation during in vitro culture, which was not rescued by supplementation, suggesting the emergence of inhibitory factors in plasma. Metabolomic assessments confirmed substantial alterations to the plasma of LPS-conditioned and acutely-infected mice, and identified a small number of candidate inhibitory metabolites, some of which could interfere with Plasmodium purine synthesis. Finally, we confirmed rapid parasite responses to systemic host inflammation in vivo using parasite scRNA-seq, noting broad impairment in transcriptional activity and translational capacity specifically in trophozoites, but not rings or schizonts. Thus, we provide evidence that systemic host inflammation rapidly triggered transcriptional alterations in circulating blood-stage Plasmodium trophozoites, and predict candidate inhibitory metabolites in the plasma that may impair parasite maturation in vivo.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001672	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8KH8C			A stress-responsive brain-gut metabolic axis instructs intestinal cell lineage commitment	The brain and gut are intricately connected in response to various stressful stimuli. Here we describe a brain-to-gut pathway in mice that instructs intestinal stem cells (ISCs) lineage commitment via bacterial metabolic signals. Psychological stress signals from the brain trigger a sympathetic pathway to enrich gut commensal Lactobacillus, which contributes to a transferrable loss of intestinal secretory cell subtypes. Indole-3-acetate (IAA) production by Lactobacillus murinus disrupts mitochondrial bioenergetics of ISCs and blocks secretory lineage commitment. In patients with mental stress, we observe similar enrichment of IAA and Lactobacillus species associated with gut dysfunction. These findings uncover a stress-responsive brain-gut signalling mechanism that skews ISCs fate decision and could be targeted for stress-driven gut-brain comorbidities.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001673	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8FQ4P			A targeted metabolomics approach for sepsis-induced ARDS and its subphenotypes	Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is etiologically and clinically a heterogeneous disease. Its diagnostic characteristics and subtype classification, and the application of these features to treatment, have been of considerable interest. Metabolomics is becoming important for identifying ARDS biology and distinguishing its subtypes. This study aimed to identify metabolites that could distinguish sepsis-induced ARDS patients from non-ARDS controls, using a targeted metabolomics approach, and to identify whether sepsis-induced direct and sepsis-induced indirect ARDS are metabolically distinct groups, and if so, confirm their metabolites and associated pathways.

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Chemotherapy resistance in lung cancer is one of the major characteristics of an aggressive phenotype with poor prognosis. Therefore, there is a critical need to explore the significant molecular changes associated with resistance to conventional chemotherapy, and identify potential therapeutic targets for treatment of resistant lung cancer. In this study, we have performed comprehensive quantitative proteomics and metabolomics analysis of non-small cell lung cancer cells (A549-P) and doxorubicin resistant A549 cells (A549-R), using state-of-the-art Trapped Ion Mobility Spectroscopy, Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (TIMS-TOF-MS). The results revealed 30 dysregulated proteins and 37 significantly altered metabolites in A549-R cells compared to A549-P cells. Among the significantly upregulated proteins are liver carboxylesterase 1, anterior gradient protein 2 homolog and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase. A group of the upregulated proteins are endogenous and xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, including UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-6, CES1, and epoxide hydrolase 1. While Importin, ATP-citrate synthase and CTP synthase are downregulated. The significantly altered metabolites include sepiapterin, glutathione, glycine, pyridine and niacinamide. The performed multi-omics integrated analysis revealed the involvement of purine and glutathione metabolism, ABC transporters, citric acid cycle in the development of resistance in A549 cells, besides the involvement of energy metabolism, pathways related to cancer progression, invasion and migration, and redox homeostasis. Collectively, this exploratory study effectively revealed the significantly dysregulated proteins and metabolites in doxorubicin resistant A549 cells and shed the light on potential biomarkers for chemotherapy resistant non-small cell lung cancer. In addition, multi-omics integrated analysis elucidates the involved pathways in resistance including pathways related to progression and invasion which would improve prognosis and open the door for new potential therapeutic targets.

Details of ChP-CSF regulation throughout the day remain unknown, largely due to lack of tools. We developed a platform for analyzing diurnal variations in mouse ChP function. We demonstrate widespread diurnal regulation of ChP secretion and barrier function across hours during the circadian day and in response to feeding cues, resulting in changes in CSF composition. ChP metabolomics uncovered increased dark phase oxidation. Transthyretin (TTR), a thyroid hormone chaperone, exhibited strong diurnal regulation and CSF-TTR levels varied across the day in register with CSF thyroid hormone levels and ChP-TTR expression. Our data will serve as a resource for the community, enabling better understanding of circadian rhythms and ChP diurnal function and regulation.

When lost in cells, its substrate fumarate accumulates to mM levels and drives oncogenic signaling and transformation. Germline alterations lead to an autosomal dominant condition known as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) where patients are predisposed to various benign tumors and an aggressive form of kidney cancer. FH alterations of unclear significance are frequently observed with germline testing; thus, there is an unmet need to classify FH variants by their cancer-associated risk, allowing for screening, early diagnosis and treatment. Here we quantify catalytic efficiency of 74 FH variants of uncertain significance. Over half were enzymatically inactive which is strong evidence of pathogenicity. We generated a panel of HLRCC cell lines expressing FH variants with a range of catalytic activities, then correlated fumarate levels with metabolic features. We found that fumarate accumulation blocks purine biosynthesis, rendering FH-deficient cells more sensitive to the purine salvage pathway inhibitor 6-mercaptopurine. Together, these findings suggest pathogenicity of many patientassociated FH variants and reveal nucleotide salvage as a targetable vulnerability in FHdeficient cancer cells.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001680	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8JH82			Uncoupled glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle in kidney cancer reveals that cytosolic GPD is essential to support lipid synthesis	The glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle (G3PS) is a major NADH shuttle that regenerates reducing equivalents in the cytosol and produces energy in the mitochondria. Here, we demonstrate that G3PS is uncoupled in kidney cancer cells where the cytosolic reaction is 4.5 times faster than the mitochondrial reaction. The high flux through cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) is required to maintain redox balance and support lipid synthesis. Interestingly, inhibition of G3PS by knocking down mitochondrial GPD (GPD2) has no effect on mitochondrial respiration. Instead, loss of GPD2 upregulates cytosolic GPD on a transcriptional level and promotes cancer cell proliferation by increasing glycerol-3-phosphate supply. The proliferative advantage of GPD2 knockdown tumor can be abolished by pharmacologic inhibition of lipid synthesis. Taken together, our results suggest that G3PS is not required to run as an intact NADH shuttle but is instead truncated to support complex lipid synthesis in kidney cancer.

We have found that increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO) during late stages of BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) treatment enables the establishment of acquired resistance. Targeting FAO with ranolazine in vivo once acquired BRAFi-resistance emerges delays tumour recurrence. Single cell RNAseq analysis revealed that ranolazine diminishes the transcriptional NGFRhigh neural crest stem cell subpopulation, which is refractory against BRAFi and immunotherapy. Moreover, by rewiring the methionine salvage pathway, ranolazine enhanced melanoma immunogenicity through increased antigen presentation and interferon signalling. Combination of ranolazine with anti-PD-L1 antibodies strongly improved survival in mice, where it increased lymphocyte infiltration and enhanced anti-tumour responses. Altogether, we show that ranolazine increases the efficacy of targeted melanoma therapy through fatty acid and methionine salvage metabolic rewiring. Importantly, our study suggests that ranolazine could sensitize BRAFi-resistant tumours to immunotherapy, by modulating melanoma cell recognition and immune infiltration. Ranolazine is an FDA and EMA-approved anti-anginal drug with very mild side effects, and our preclinical data encourage its use as a therapeutic option to improve the two main therapeutic strategies currently used to treat metastatic melanoma.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001682	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8914J			Loss of microglial MCT4 leads to defective synaptic pruning and anxiety-like behavior in mice	Microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system, actively participate in brain development by supporting neuronal maturation and refining synaptic connections. These cells are emerging as highly metabolically flexible, able to oxidize different energetic substrates to meet their energy demand. Lactate is particularly abundant in the brain, but whether microglia use it as a metabolic fuel has been poorly explored. Here we show that microglia can import lactate, and this is coupled with increased lysosomal acidification. In vitro, loss of the monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 in microglia prevents lactate-induced lysosomal modulation and leads to defective cargo degradation. Microglial depletion of MCT4 in vivo leads to impaired synaptic pruning, associated with increased excitation in hippocampal neurons, enhanced E/I ratio, vulnerability to seizures and anxiety-like phenotype. Overall, these findings show that selective disruption of the MCT4 transporter in microglia is sufficient to alter synapse refinement and to induce defects in brain development and adult behavior.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001683	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8599Z			Metabolic alteration of MCF-7 cells upon indirect exposure to E. coli secretome: A model of studying the microbiota effect on human breast tissue	Cancer is a challenging disease that requires a comprehensive approach for effective treatment. Various bacterial species, including clostridia, bifidobacteria, and salmonellae, have been investigated in numerous animal tumor models, cell lines, and clinical trials as gene carriers for anti-cancerous genes, including tumor suppressor genes, suicide genes, or tumor-associated antigens. Therefore, they render cell cancer more sensitive to treatment, and they can be used as drug/gene delivery vehicles. E. coli, as one of the breast tissue microbiomes, secretes metabolites that could influence the metabolism of MCF-7 cells to ensure their survival. This in vitro investigation concentrated primarily on the role of E. coli secretome modulation on the MCF-7 cells metabolism. The intra- and extracellular metabolomes of the E. coli secretome and secretome exposed MCF-7 cells were profiled using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics approach. Secretome-exposed MCF-7 cells were compared to unexposed controls; a total of 31 and 56 metabolites were significantly altered intra- and extracellularly, respectively. The most common metabolic pathways dysregulated after exposure were aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, purine metabolism, and energy metabolism. The decrease in some purine metabolites would suggest that altering nucleotide metabolism is one of the ways the bacterial secretome kills cancer cells. The maximum discrimination between the two groups was found in lactate levels, which plays a crucial role in cancer progression. The Warburg effect causes cancer tissue to have an acidic microenvironment, which impacts cancer cell metastasis and proliferation, inflammation, immune cell function, and blood vessel development; the decrease in lactate content may also be a method by which the secretome affects cancer. Finally, some microbial metabolites from bacterial secretome have shown promising anticancer effects and can be employed as innovative ways for cancer treatment, either alone or in combination with other medicines.

First, we performed unbiased quantitative mass spectrometry on the myocardium of 25-27 pre-mortem cryopreserved non-diseased human hearts to compare the metabolome and proteome between the normal left and right ventricles. Constituents of gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, lipogenesis, lipolysis, fatty acid catabolism, the citrate cycle and oxidative phosphorylation were down-regulated in the left ventricle, while glycogenesis, pyruvate and ketone metabolism were up-regulated. Inter-ventricular significance of these metabolic pathways was then found to be diminished within end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy and ischaemic cardiomyopathy (n = 30-33), while heart failure-associated pathways were increased in the left ventricle relative to the right within ischaemic cardiomyopathy, such as fluid sheer-stress, increased glutamine to glutamate ratio, and down-regulation of contractile proteins indicating a left ventricular pathological bias.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001685	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8WT6H			SAND: automated time-domain modeling of NMR spectra applied to metabolic quantification	New developments in untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics enable the profiling of hundreds to thousands of biological samples in biomedical studies, with great potential in drug discovery and diagnostics. The exploitation of this rich information requires detailed quantification of spectral features. However, the development of a consistent and automatic workflow for NMR feature quantification has been a long-standing challenge because of the difficulties of extensive spectral overlap. To address this challenge, we introduce the software SAND (Spectral Automated NMR Deconvolution), for automated feature quantification in the time domain. SAND follows upon the previous success of time-domain modeling and provides automated quantification of entire spectra without the need for manual interaction. SAND employs subsampling, global optimization, and statistic model selection, which are readily expandable to higher dimensional NMR and non-uniform sampling applications. Here, we demonstrate the accuracy of the SAND approach (a correlation around 0.9) using highly overlapped simulated datasets, a two-compound mixture, and a urine spectral series spiked with differing amounts of a four-compound mixture. We further demonstrate automated annotation using correlation networks derived from SAND deconvoluted peaks, and on average 74% of peaks for each compound can be recovered in a single correlation network cluster. SAND is currently integrated with NMRbox and the Network for Advanced NMR (NAN).

The aim of this study is to determine whether a stool genomic and metabolic signature accurately detects hepatic decompensation and mortality risk in cirrhosis secondary to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Based on the severity of cirrhosis, cirrhosis patients can be categorized as compensated or decompensated. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on fecal samples collected from a prospective cohort of adults with NAFLD-related cirrhosis. The signatures were further validated with a metabolomic study on fecal and serum samples. Finally, we developed a Random Forest machine learning algorithm to make predictions on hepatic decompensation and mortality in NAFLD-related cirrhosis. Here we uploaded the metabolomics study data of serum samples in LC-MS/MS analysis.

Inflammation plays both direct and indirect roles in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), atherogenic cardiovascular diseases, and other causes of morbidity and mortality. In preliminary USDA-NIFA funded studies, we found that individuals of distinct low and high inflammation phenotypes have distinct metabolomic signatures in their blood. Anthocyanins and fiber of bioactive components of foods that have been shown to lower inflammation. However, there is tremendous inter-individual variability in bioavailability of anthocyanins and production of phenolic and aromatic metabolites in the colon that depends, at least in part, on digestive metabolism by microorganisms (the microbiota) in the gut. Fiber which acts as a prebiotic to enrich favorable gut microbes and as a fermentation substrate to produce favorable or unfavorable metabolites according to the unique makeup of the gut microbiota. However, little is known about the complex interactions among the gut microbiome, anti-inflammatory food metabolomic signatures, and human inflammation phenotypes. We propose a of human mechanistic clinical trials and mice humanized with fecal microbiome transplants to disentangle these complex interactions. To determine the metabolomic signatures anti-inflammatory foods and key bioactive components and determine associations with constituents of the gut microbiome (Aim 1A), we will measure in a human cohort the makeup of the gut microbiome and metabolomic changes induced by acute (3 d) ingestion of 1) chokeberry and chokeberry anthocyanins (n=75), and 2) lentils and lentil fiber (n=75). To determine whether these foods are related to the metabolomic signatures of low versus high inflammation phenotypes (Aim 1B), we will compare the metabolites and associated metabolic pathways of chokeberry, chokeberry anthocyanins, lentils, and lentil fiber to those associated with low and high inflammation phenotypes. To determine the impact of inter-individual variability of the gut microbiome on metabolomic signatures (Aim 2A), we will humanize mice with a diverse collection of human gut microbiomes and determine whether the makeup of the microbiome predicts features (metabolites) of chokeberry/anthocyanin, lentils/fiber metabolomic signatures. Findings from these experiments directly address the PAR-18-727 program area priority of “identification and validation of food and nutrient specific metabolic signatures that correlate with nutrient quality and efficacy and provide insights to develop synergistic food prebiotic based therapies to convert humans from high to low inflammation phenotypes to reduce disease risk and severity.

In both diseases, red blood cell injury and anemia are the impetus for end organ injury. Because persistent erythrophagocytosis is a hallmark of these genetic maladies it is critical to understand how macrophage phenotype polarizations in tissue compartments can inform on disease progression. Murine models of sickle cell disease and Beta-thalassemia allow for a basic understanding of mechanisms and provide for translation to human disease. A multi-omics approach to understanding macrophage metabolism and protein changes in two murine models of beta-globinopathy was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as spleen and liver macrophages isolated from Berkley sickle cell disease (Berk-ss) and heterozygous B1/B2 globin gene deletion (Hbbth3/+) mice. Results from these experiments revealed the metabolome and proteome of macrophages are polarized to a distinct phenotype in Berk-ss and Hbbth3/+ compared each other and their common background mice (C57BL6/J). Further, spleen and liver macrophages revealed distinct disease specific phenotypes, suggesting macrophages become differentially polarized and reprogrammed within tissue compartments. We conclude that tissue recruitment, polarization, metabolic and proteomic reprogramming of macrophages in Berk-ss and Hbbth3/+ mice may be relevant to disease to progression in other tissue.

Morphological transition allows yeast cells to diffuse through bloodstream to colonize internal organs, whilst filamentous forms is related to penetration of host mucosa and epidermal surfaces. With the help of novel analytical techniques and instruments developed in the past years, which enabled accurate, simultaneous detection and quantification of proteins and metabolites. We investigated and compared the proteome and metabolome of C. albicans grown on agar plate verses suspension culture to gain insight into the different environmental adaptation and response to stress. Multi-omics (proteomics & metabolomics) analyses were performed using a high-resolution timsTOF mass spectrometer. From the findings reported in this experiment it is worth highlighting that ease of nutritional access in suspension media favours core growth metabolism and increased translation, while impeded access in solid media favours more diverse metabolic pathways. Core growth and replication machinery are enhanced in suspension media, with several terms related to protein translation and core metabolism increased in this media. In contrast, pathogenic cell wall proteins and proteins related to cell surface were increased in cells grown on solid media.

However, the effectiveness of current anti-prostate cancer drugs is limited due to increasing drug resistance and side effects. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop new compounds and identify novel drug targets that can surpass these limitations. Due to their targeted mechanism, DNA minor groove binders (MGBs) are becoming more popular as a relatively safe and effective alternative. In our research, we employed multi-omics techniques to investigate the mechanism of action of a novel MGB compound (MGB4) through LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics combined with discovery proteomics analysis performed on LNCaP cells, which were treated with MGB4, doxorubicin, or a combination of both compounds. Through a one-way ANOVA test with a significance level of p-value < 0.05, we identified 99 metabolites and 1143 proteins associated with the treatments. Our findings indicate that treating LNCaP cells with doxorubicin or the MGB4 lead compound yielded similar effects, albeit not identical, on the cells. Both compounds deactivated the translation pathway in the cells. Furthermore, we observed alterations in sphingolipid and amino acid metabolic pathways, potentially contributing to the suppression of prostate cancer cell proliferation and division. Additionally, doxorubicin and combined treatments resulted in reduced metabolism of spermine and spermidine, likely stemming from decreased protein synthesis of key enzymes involved in their pathways. Moreover, the combined treatment exhibited a synergistic interaction between the two compounds, leading to altered purine metabolism and a more pronounced reduction in metabolite abundance compared to individual treatments. Overall, our study demonstrates the robustness of the multi-omics approach in elucidating the mechanism of action of promising drug candidates. It also suggests that MGB4 shows potential as a candidate for prostate cancer treatment.

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) exhibit a high risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) which is not fully explained by the classical Framingham risk factors. SLE is characterized by major metabolic alterations which can contribute to the elevated prevalence of CVD. In order to address this hypothesis, a comprehensive analysis of the circulating metabolome and lipidome was conducted in a large cohort of 211 women with SLE who underwent a multi-detector computed tomography scan for quantification of coronary artery calcium (CAC), a robust predictor of coronary heart disease (CHD). Results. Beyond traditional risk factors, including age and hypertension, disease activity and duration were independent risk factor for developing CAC in women with SLE. The presence of coronary calcium was associated with major alterations of circulating lipidome dominated by an elevated abundance of ceramides with very long chain fatty acids. Alterations in multiple metabolic pathways, including purine, arginine and proline metabolism, and microbiota-derived metabolites, were also associated with CAC in women with SLE. Backward stepwise logistic regression models of lipidomic and metabolomic variables were used to develop prognostic scores. Strikingly, combining metabolic and lipidomic variables with clinical and biological parameters markedly improved the prediction (area under the curve: 0.887, P<0.001) of the presence of coronary calcium in women with SLE. Conclusion. The present study uncovers the contribution of disturbed metabolism to the presence of coronary artery calcium and the prediction of CHD in SLE. Identification of novel lipid and metabolite biomarkers may help stratifying patients for reducing CVD morbidity and mortality in SLE.

Therefore, T2DM-related treatments and therapies are continuously invented for the clinical use, including Liraglutide. The last is a GLP-1 analogue and shows its beneficial health outcomes e.g., improved glycemic control, lower body weight, and reduced cardiovascular disease risks. The intrinsic mechanisms of these beneficial effects are not fully understood; however, our research group has previously published proteomics work demonstrating the involvement of certain important proteins in part in the beneficial health outcomes of Liraglutide. Since proteomics and metabolomics are complementary to each other in the context of the biological pathways, studying the metabolic impacts of Liraglutide on T2DM patients would add further information about the beneficial health outcomes of Liraglutide. Thus, herein, we performed an untargeted metabolomics approach for identifying metabolic pathways impacted by the treatment of Liraglutide in T2DM patients. Methods: Untargeted liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used for metabolomics analysis of plasma samples collected from T2DM patients (n=20) before and after receiving Liraglutide treatment. Metabolic profiling and related pathway and network analyses were conducted. Results: The metabolic profiling analyses identified 93 endogenous metabolites were significantly affected by the Liraglutide treatments, which 49 metabolites up-regulated and 44 metabolites down-regulated. Moreover, the metabolic pathway analyses revealed that the most pronounced metabolite and metabolic pathways that were affected by the Liraglutide treatment was Pentose and glucuronate interconversion, suggesting the last may be a potential target of the Liraglutide treatment could be involved in part in the beneficial effects seen in T2DM patients, specially, we found that glucuronate interconversion pathway which is known by its role in eliminating toxic and undesirable substances from the human body, impacted in Liraglutide treated patients. The last findings ar consistence with our previous proteomics findings. Conclusion: These findings, taken together with our previous results, provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of Liraglutide at the proteomic and metabolic levels in T2DM patients.

Background: Severe or recurrent myocardial ischemia can lead to chronic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and heart failure in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Objectives: To assess the multiomic profile of LV myocardium in patients with stable CAD. Methods: Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) had preoperative quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance. During surgery, paired transmural LV biopsies were acquired on the beating heart from a region of inducible ischemia, and a remote LV segment. LV samples from human organ donors were used as controls. Myocardial biopsies underwent high-energy phosphate quantification, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and single-nuclei ribonucleic acid sequencing. Results: From 33 patients, 63 LV biopsies were acquired on the beating heart during CABG (mean age 60±9 years, median LV ejection fraction 67% [IQR: 61-71%]). Analysis of LV samples from 11 essentially healthy donor hearts were included. The global myocardial ATP/ADP ratio was reduced in CAD patients as compared to donor LV tissue (median [IQR]: 2.2 [1.5-2.8] versus 7.4 [6.8-8.6], P=0.001), with increased expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes encoding the electron transport chain complexes across multiple cell types. Paired analyses of biopsies obtained during CABG from LV segments with or without inducible ischemia revealed no significant difference in the ATP/ADP ratio (P=0.36), broader metabolic profile or expression of ventricular cardiomyocyte genes implicated in OXPHOS. Conclusions: Our results suggest that viable human myocardium in patients with stable CAD has global alterations in bioenergetic and transcriptional profile without large regional differences between areas with or without inducible ischemia.

However, the exact biological functions of 2’-FL and corresponding mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the impact of 2’-FL on gut microbial metabolism for the prevention of colitis in adulthood. The gut microbiota from adult mice treated with 2’-FL showed an increase in abundance of several health-associated genera, including Bifidobacterium, and exhibited preventive effects on colitis. Microbial metabolic analysis demonstrated that 26 pathways that are significantly different between non-inflammatory bowel disease individuals and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are significantly regulated by 2’-FL in mice, indicating that 2’-FL has the potential to directly regulate dysregulated microbial metabolism in UC. Exploratory metabolomics of Bifidobacterium infantis identified novel secreted metabolites significantly enriched by 2’-FL consumption, including pantothenol. Remarkably, pantothenate significantly protects mucosal barrier and mitigates colitis in adult mice. Thus 2’-FL-modulated gut microbial metabolism may contribute to the prevention of intestinal inflammation in adulthood.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001704	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8FM85			Metabolic effect of Lamin A/C in oligodendrocyte on brain function	Oligodendrocytes are specialized cells which insulate and support axons with their myelin membrane, allowing proper brain function. Here, we identify Lamin A/C (LMNA/C) as essential for transcriptional and functional stability of myelinating oligodendrocytes. We show that LMNA/C levels increase with differentiation of progenitors and that loss of Lmna in differentiated oligodendrocytes profoundly alters their chromatin accessibility and transcriptional signature. Lmna deletion in myelinating glia is compatible with normal developmental myelination. However, altered chromatin accessibility is detected in fully differentiated oligodendrocytes together with increased expression of progenitor genes and decreased levels of lipid-related transcription factors and inner mitochondrial membrane transcripts. As mice age, they start to develop myelin-thinning and progressively worsening motor phenotype. To address the metabolic effect of LMNA/C in oligodendrocyte on brain function, we carried out LC-MS/MS metabolomic study of myelinating glia cell specific Lmna conditional knockout and wildtype mice brains at 26 weeks. Each LC-MS/MS experiment was performed with 3 biological replicates and 4 technical replicates per genotype. Overall, our data identify LMNA/C as essential for maintaining the transcriptional and functional stability of myelinating oligodendrocytes.

While the metabolic role of ACSS2 in cancer is well described, the consequences of blocking tumour acetate metabolism on the tumour microenvironment and anti-tumour immunity are unknown. We demonstrate that blocking ACSS2 switches cancer cells from acetate consumers to producers of acetate thereby freeing acetate for tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes to use as a fuel source. We show that acetate supplementation metabolically bolsters T-cell effector functions and proliferation. Targeting ACSS2 with CRISPR-Cas9 guides or a small molecule inhibitor promotes an anti-tumour immune response and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy in preclinical breast cancer models. We propose a novel paradigm for targeting acetate metabolism in cancer in which inhibition of ACSS2 dually acts to impair tumour cell metabolism and potentiate anti-tumour immunity.

Although obtaining multi-omics data is relatively easy, methods that analyze such data have been lagging. In this paper, we present an algorithm that uses probabilistic graph representations and external knowledge to perform optimum structure learning and deduce a multifarious interaction network for multi-omics data from a bacterial community. Kefir grain, a microbial community that ferments milk and creates kefir, represents a self-renewing, stable, natural microbial community. Kefir has been shown to associate with a wide range of health benefits. We obtained a controlled bacterial community using the two most abundant and well-studied species in kefir grains: Lentilactobacillus kefiri and Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. We applied growth temperatures of 30°C and 37°C, and obtained transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic data for the same 20 samples (10 samples per temperature). We obtained a multi-omics interaction network, which generated insights that would not have been possible with single-omics analysis. We identified interactions among transcripts, proteins, and metabolites suggesting active toxin/antitoxin systems. We also observed multifarious interactions that involved the shikimate pathway. These observations helped explain bacterial adaptation to different stress conditions, co-aggregation, and increased activation of L. kefiranofaciens at 37°C.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001710	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8P43M			Evolutionary genomics identifies host-directed therapeutics to treat intracellular bacterial infections	Obligate intracellular bacteria from the Rickettsiaceae family have shed essential biosynthetic pathways during their evolution towards host dependency. By systematically comparing this cytosolic family of bacteria to the related vacuolar Anaplasmataceae family using a novel computational pipeline called PoMeLo, we identified 20 metabolic pathways that may have been lost since the divergence of Anaplasmataceae and Rickettsiaceae, corresponding to the latter’s change to a cytosolic niche. We hypothesized that drug inhibition of these host metabolic pathways would reduce the levels of metabolic products available to the bacteria, thereby inhibiting bacterial growth. We tested 22 commercially available inhibitors for 14 of the identified pathways and found that 59% of the inhibitors reduced bacterial growth at concentrations that did not contribute to host cell cytotoxicity. Of these, 5 inhibitors with an IC50 under 5 µM were tested to determine whether their mode of inhibition was bactericidal or bacteriostatic. Both mycophenolate mofetil, an inhibitor of inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase in the purine biosynthesis pathway, and roseoflavin, an analog of riboflavin, displayed bactericidal activity. We then took an unbiased metabolomics approach to Rickettsia-infected cells to determine whether there was any overlap between our predicted host pathways and depletion of metabolite levels in infected cells, as measured by mass spectrometry. Our results show that 13 pathways were identified as metabolic gaps in both our computational predictions and our metabolomics analysis. These in vitro validation studies support the feasibility of a novel evolutionary genomics-guided approach for antibiotic drug development against obligate pathogens.

HER2 is a driver oncogene overexpressed in the majority of premalignant breast tumors known as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Due to their stemness features, breast cancer stem cells (BCSC) are considered the main drivers of breast tumor initiation and progression. Here, we used clinical samples and mouse models of HER2+ breast tumorigenesis to demonstrate that neither BCSCs nor their cell-of-origin express HER2/Neu in early-stage breast tumors. Instead, our results demonstrate that Neu overexpression results in the transformation of BCSCs in a non-cell autonomous manner via triggering DNA damage and somatic mutagenesis in their Neu-negative cell-of-origin. This is caused by the increased oxidative stress in the tissue microenvironment generated by altered energy metabolism and increased reactive oxygen species level in Neu-overexpressing mammary ducts. Therefore, our findings illustrate a previously unrecognized mechanism of HER2-induced breast tumor initiation, which may have an impact on future preventive treatments for patients with HER2+ DCIS.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001715	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M81D9R			Developmental programming of Kupffer cells by maternal obesity causes fatty liver disease in the offspring	Kupffer cells (KCs) are tissue-resident macrophages which colonize the developing liver early during embryogenesis. Throughout development and adulthood, KCs have distinct core functions that are essential for liver and organismal homeostasis, such as supporting fetal erythropoiesis as well as postnatal erythrocyte recycling and liver metabolism. KCs acquire their tissue-specific transcriptional signature immediately after colonizing the liver, mature together with the tissue, and adapt to the tissue’s function. However, whether perturbation of macrophage core functions during development may contribute to or cause disease at postnatal stages is poorly understood. Here, we utilize a maternal obesity model to disturb KC functions during gestation. We show that offspring born to obese mothers develop fatty liver disease that is accompanied by a local pro-inflammatory response, a phenotype that is augmented if the offspring is kept on control diet after birth. Further, transcriptional analyses reveal that KCs undergo developmental programming through the maternal high-fat diet, which lasts until adulthood. The offspring’s KC developmental programming is irreversible despite the switch to control diet and leads to increased lipid uptake in hepatocytes mediated via paracrine factors stemming from KCs. The transcriptional programming of KCs and the fatty liver disease phenotype are rescued by genetic depletion of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (Hif-1alpha) in macrophages during gestation. These results demonstrate that macrophages rely on an undisturbed development to fulfil their core functions and support organ homeostasis during adulthood, and establish developmental programming of KCs as a therapeutic strategy for metabolic disorders, such as fatty liver disease.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001716	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8WM6F			Metabolomics Profiling of the Antiproliferative, Anti-migratory and Anti-invasive Potential of Amlodipine in Lung Cancer Cells	Lung cancer is still among the most leading causes of cancer-related deaths across the world. Although chemotherapy is considered as a critical choice to manage/limit cancer growth in lung cancer patients with early-stage and advanced cancer stages, it has many limitations including, at least, the severe side effects and chemoresistance. The latter is one of the considerable challenges to lung cancer treatment. Therefore, identification of new alternative therapies with lesser cytotoxic effects when compared to the currently used chemotherapeutics is one of the current research approaches. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are emerging as anti-cancer agents in several cancer types. Our objective is to determine the cytotoxic effect of amlodipine on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Colorimetric MTT cell proliferation assay was used to analyze cell viability following treatments with amlodipine in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cell lines. ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test were used to detect statistical significance. Half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were obtained by applying nonlinear regression curve fit analysis. To assess the effect of amlodipine on A549 and H1299 NSCLC cells migration and invasion scratch wound-healing assay and cell invasion assay were used. Our study revealed that amlodipine significantly reduced proliferation of cancer cells in a dose-dependent fashion with half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 23 and 25.66 µM in A549 and H1299 cells, respectively. Furthermore, amlodipine was able to reduce the invasiveness and migration of cancer cells, both of which are hallmarks in the pathogenesis of cancer, in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Accordingly, our study provides empirical evidence that amlodipine expresses anti-cancer effect to NSCLC cells. However, additional investigations are required to further confirm our results on a larger scale at the clinical level.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001717	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8RX4J			Measurement of metabolites in liver of male mice treated with TCDD	The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a transcription factor activated by structurally diverse chemicals, endogenous metabolites, and natural products. AhR activation causes the dissociation of chaperone proteins, followed by translocation to the nucleus and dimerization with the AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT). The complex binds dioxin response elements (DREs; 5’-GCGTG-3’) eliciting changes in gene expression. AhR activation by its most potent ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) promotes the development and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a spectrum of pathologies that spans simple, reversible, and benign lipid accumulation (hepatic steatosis), to steatosis with inflammation (steatohepatitis) and collagen deposition (fibrosis/cirrhosis) in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption. NAFLD prevalence is projected to increase from ~83 million in 2015 to ~101 million by 2030 in the US alone, while increasing the risk for more complex disorders including Metabolic Syndrome, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The role of AhR-mediated metabolic dysregulation in hepatotoxicity and the etiology of more complex metabolic diseases warrants further investigation. Therofore, in this project on PND28 mice were orally gavaged at the start of the light cycle (zeitgeber [ZT] 0-1) with 0.1 ml sesame oil vehicle or 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 ug/kg body weight TCDD every 4 days for 28 days for a total of 7 treatments. The first gavage was administered on day 0, with the last gavage administered on day 24 of the 28-day study. On day 28, tissue samples were harvested (ZT 0-3), immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until analysis.

We conducted a high-resolution mass spectrometry based untargeted lipidomics analysis of pre-diagnostic serum samples from a nested case-control study (219 liver cancer cases and 219 controls) within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study. Out of 462 annotated lipids, 158 (34.2%) were associated with liver cancer risk in a conditional logistic regression analysis at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. A chemical set enrichment analysis (ChemRICH) and co-regulatory set analysis suggested that 22/28 lipid classes and 47/83 correlation modules were significantly associated with liver cancer risk (FDR <0.05). Strong positive associations were observed for monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), triacylglycerols (TAGs), and phosphatidylcholines (PCs) having MUFA acyl chains. Negative associations were observed for sphingolipids (ceramides and sphingomyelins), lysophosphatidylcholines, cholesterol esters and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) containing TAGs and PCs. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme 1 (SCD1), a rate limiting enzyme in fatty acid metabolism and ceramidases seems to be critical in this reprogramming. In conclusion, our study reports pre-diagnostic lipid changes that provide novel insights into hepatic lipid metabolism reprogramming may contribute to a pro-cell growth and anti-apoptotic tissue environment and, in turn, support liver cancer initiation.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are biopersistent pollutants and, due to their diverse applications, have become global contaminants. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a prevalent PFAS congener, impairs humoral immunity; however, its impact on innate immunity is unclear. Given the critical roles of innate immune cells, namely microglia, in brain development and homeostasis, we asked whether exposure adversely affects microglial function. Herein, we demonstrate developmental PFOS exposure produces microglial activation and upregulation of the microglia activation gene p2ry12. PFOS-induced microglial activation heightened microglial responses to brain injury, in the absence of increased cell death or inflammation. Use of the photoconvertible calcium indicator CaMPARI revealed PFOS exposure heightened neural activity, while optogenetic silencing of neurons was sufficient to normalize microglial responses to injury. Through an untargeted metabolome wide association study (MWAS), we further determined that PFOS-exposed larvae exhibit significant neurochemical imbalances. Exposure to the perfluorooctanoic acid, an immunotoxic PFAS, did not alter neuronal activity or microglial behavior, further supporting a role for neural activity as a critical modifier of microglial function. Together, this study reveals how contaminant-induced changes in brain activity can shape brain health.

Metabolomics provides a snapshot of dynamic biochemical activities, including those found to be driving tumor formation and progression. This study used untargeted metabolomics with network analysis to agnostically identify network modules and independent metabolites in pre-diagnostic blood samples among never-smokers to further understand the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Methods and Findings: Within the prospective Shanghai Women’s Health Study, we conducted a nested case-control study of 395 never-smoking incident lung cancer cases and 395 never-smoking controls matched on age. We performed liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry to quantify 20,348 metabolic features in plasma. We agnostically constructed 28 network modules using a weighted correlation network analysis approach and assessed associations for network modules and individual metabolites with lung cancer using conditional logistic regression models, adjusting for covariates. We accounted for multiple testing using a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.20. We identified a network module of 122 metabolic features enriched in lysophosphatidylethanolamines that was associated with all lung cancer combined (p = 0.001, FDR = 0.028) and lung adenocarcinoma (p = 0.002, FDR = 0.056) and another network module of 440 metabolic features that was associated with lung adenocarcinoma (p = 0.014, FDR = 0.196). Metabolic features were enriched in pathways associated with cell growth and proliferation, including oxidative stress, bile acid biosynthesis, and metabolism of nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids, including 1-carbon compounds. Conclusions: Our prospective study suggests that untargeted plasma metabolomics in pre-diagnostic samples could provide new insights into the etiology of lung cancer in never-smokers. Replication and further characterization of these associations are warranted.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001731	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8ZD8R			Defective Branched-Chain Amino Acid Catabolism in Dorsal Root Ganglia Contributes to Mechanical Pain	Impaired branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism has recently been implicated in the development of mechanical pain, but the molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here we report that defective BCAA catabolism in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons sensitizes mice to mechanical pain by increasing lactate production and Piezo2 expression, a mechanotransduction channel. In high-fat diet fed obese mice, we observed a downregulation of PP2Cm, a key regulator in BCAA catabolic pathway, in DRG neurons. Mice with conditional knockout of PP2Cm in DRG neurons (cKO) exhibited mechanical allodynia under normal or spare nerve injury (SNI)-induced neuropathic injury conditions. Further, in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain, we found that the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores were positively correlated with BCAA contents in plasma, highlighting a link between peripheral neuropathic pain and dysregulated BCAA catabolism. Mechanistically, defective BCAA catabolism promotes the production of lactate through glycolysis in DRG neurons, which increases H3K18la modification and drives Piezo2 expression. Inhibition of lactate production or silencing of Piezo2 expression attenuated the pain phenotype of cKO to mechanical stimuli. Therefore, our study demonstrates a casual role of defective BCAA catabolism in mechanical pain by enhancing metabolite-mediated epigenetic regulation.

The goal of this study is to quantify a panel of targeted metabolite intermediates from glycolysis, phosphate energy pool, and mitochondrial activity including the TCA cycle. Metabolites were extracted from the dissected tissues, reconstituted, and analyzed using liquid chromatography (LC) electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS). The targeted metabolite measurements were performed on a trapped ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometer (timsTOF PRO, Bruker). Targeted MS assays on the metabolite intermediates produced downstream, complemented by classical fluorescence-based metabolite assays when available, revealed local oxidative stress and enrichment of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the SMO.

Plant roots show functional heterogeneity in cellular architecture, transcriptome, metabolic states, and immunity. We hypothesized that axial differentiation impacts spatial colonization by rhizobiota along the root axis. We developed two growth systems, ArtSoil and CD-Rhizotrons, to dissect Arabidopsis thaliana roots into three segments. We identified distinct rhizobiota communities in the segments, supporting spatial microbiota differentiation along the axis. Root metabolite profiling revealed differential enrichment and specificity. Correlation analyses point to strong reliance of rhizobiota on carbohydrate supply from the host. Bioinformatic analyses and GUS histochemistry indicate sugar and/or microbe-induced accumulation of SWEET2, 4, and 12 sugar uniporters. Profiling of root-segments in sweet mutants showed impaired spatial rhizobiota arrangement. Correlation analysis revealed complex interconnected metabolite-rhizobiota networks. This work uncovers interdependency between root physiology and microbiota colonization and a contribution of SWEETs to shaping local adaptation of root microbiota.

They alter the balance between light and nutrients, shifting community composition on both the species and molecular scale. Here, we collected metabolomic samples from across eddy dipoles in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre to detect and quantify these shifts on a chemical level. The data indicate that metabolites dynamically and robustly track with biological community metrics and result in biochemically distinct particulate matter in cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies."

Murine Panc02 and KPC FC1245 pancreatic cancer cell lines were genetically engineered using a doxycycline inducible CRISPR/Cas9 platform with a target specific gRNA for CDA and a control non-targeting NT gRNA. CDA knockdown cells show a significant decrease of intracellular uridine levels and the accumulation of intracellular cytidine. Consistent with the decrease in intracellular uridine, sgCda cells show reduced intracellular levels of UMP, UDP and UTP compared to sgNT cells while we see no change in adenine and cytosine nucleotides (i.e., AMP, ADP, ATP and CMP, CDP, CTP, respectively) or in UDP-hexose.

Here, we describe MIPS2673, a selective inhibitor of the Plasmodium M1 alanyl metalloaminopeptidase, which displays excellent in vitro antimalarial activity with no significant host cell toxicity. Biochemical assays revealed potent inhibition of recombinant Plasmodium falciparum (PfA-M1) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv-M1) M1 metalloaminopeptidases, with selectivity over other Plasmodium and human aminopeptidases. Orthogonal chemoproteomic methods based on thermal stability and limited proteolysis reproducibly identified PfA-M1 as the sole target of MIPS2673 in parasites from approximately 2,000 detected proteins. Furthermore, the limited proteolysis approach enabled estimation of the binding site on PfA-M1 to within ~5 Å of that determined by X-ray crystallography. Functional investigation by untargeted metabolomics further demonstrated that MIPS2673 inhibits the key role of PfA-M1 in haemoglobin digestion. Combined, our proteomics and metabolomics target deconvolution strategies provided unbiased confirmation of the on-target activity of a PfA-M1 inhibitor, and validated selective inhibition of this enzyme as a promising multi-stage and cross-species antimalarial strategy.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001742	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8J71N			Metabolomics Study on Plasma and Lung Tissue of Rats Exposed to Whole Thorax Irradiation	Although some progress has been made in the study of radiation injury, there are still no effective prevention and treatment methods for severe acute radiation syndrome or sickness (ARS). Accordingly, a thorough understanding of biological characteristics associated with high-dose radiation is essential for revealing the mechanisms underlying the varied biological processes following high dose radiation and the development of novel potent radioprotective agents. Therefore, in this paper, we investigated the metabolic characteristics of plasma and lung tissue of rats exposed to whole-thorax irradiation (WTI) by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The correlation of metabolic characteristics between plasma and lung tissue of WTI rats was studied. Parallel metabolic pathway analysis of common differential metabolites suggests that the metabolic characteristics of plasma can reflect the metabolic changes of RILI. On this basis, the potential plasma biomarkers of RILI (acylcarnitine C9:1, acylcarnitine C5:0, taurocholic acid and tauro-a-Muricholic acid) were screened, and their dose-response patterns suggest that they have the potential for early diagnosis and evaluation of RILI.

(Lamiaceae) comprises myriad distinct medicinal herbs, with terpenoids as one of their major active chemical groups. Abietane-type diterpenoids (ATDs), such as tanshinones and carnosic acids, are specific to Salvia and exhibit taxonomic chemical diversity among lineages. To elucidate how ATD chemical diversity evolved, we carried out large-scale metabolic and phylogenetic analyses of 71 Salvia species, combined with enzyme function, ancestral sequence and chemical trait reconstruction, and comparative genomics experiments. This integrated approach showed that the lineage-wide ATD diversities in Salvia were induced by differences in the oxidation of the terpenoid skeleton at C-20, which was caused by the functional divergence of the cytochrome P450 subfamily CYP76AK. These findings present a unique pattern of chemical diversity in plants that was shaped by the loss of enzyme activity and associated catalytic pathways.

Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a constellation of disturbances caused by unequal blood flow within the shared placenta giving rise to a major hemodynamic imbalance between the twins. If untreated, it leads to fetal cardiac failure and death. Here, we applied TTTS as a model to uncover fetal metabolic adaptations to cardiovascular stress. We compared untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analyses of amniotic fluid samples from a cohort of severe TTTS cases showing sonographic evidence of increased afterload and heart failure vs. uncomplicated singleton controls. Amniotic fluid metabolites demonstrated footprints of changes in fatty acid, glucose, and steroid hormone metabolism in TTTS. Among TTTS cases, unsupervised principal component analysis revealed two distinct clusters of disease defined by levels of glucose metabolites, amino acids, urea, and redox status. Our results suggest that the human fetal heart can adapt to hemodynamic stress by modulating its glucose metabolism. Furthermore, we have uncovered heterogeneity among cases of severe TTTS suggesting potential differences in the ability of individual fetuses to respond to cardiovascular stress.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001747	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8WH9J			Hepatic oxylipin profiles in mouse models of Wilson disease: new insights into early hepatic manifestations.	Hepatic inflammation is commonly identified in Wilson disease (WD), a genetic disease of hepatic and brain copper accumulation. Copper accumulation is associated with increased reactive oxygen species and activation of the non-enzymatic oxidation of membrane-bound polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), with impairment of cellular structures and function. Products of PUFA oxidation are collectively known as oxylipins (OXL), which can also be produced via enzymatic pathways including lipoxygenases (LOXs), cyclooxygenases (COXs), and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs). These bioactive lipids modulate hepatic inflammation. We aimed to examine hepatic OXLs profile at early stages of WD in mouse model of Wilson disease, the toxic milk from The Jackson Laboratory (tx-j) compared to mice with normal copper metabolism (C3H). Targeted lipidomic profiling of OXLs was performed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) in livers from 16 weeks old male and female mice. Hepatic OXL profiles were altered, with higher levels of PUFA alcohols, diols, and ketones. Markers of oxidative stress, 9-HETE and 9-HEPE were increased in tx-j mice. Hepatic prostaglandin and thromboxane levels in the COX pathway were increased in tx-j mice. tx-j showed altered PUFA-epoxides, suggesting altered CYP(s) activities. Our findings suggest that both non-enzymatic ROS-dependent and enzymatic PUFAs oxidation via COX and LOX pathways are associated with early stages liver disease in WD. It also indicates altered CYPs activities in animal model of WD. These novel pathways could be the target for future therapies.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001748	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8RQ7M			Investigation of metabolism in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy	We propose the use of targeted metabolomics to define the metabolic and molecular pathways altered in 2 mouse models (R92W-TnT and R403Q-MHC) of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) that span the spectrum of human disease (heart failure and sudden death), with the goal of identifying treatment targets. Parallel targeted metabolomics studies will be performed in heart tissue and plasma at rest and following inotrope stimulation. Since energy compromise is expected to be most marked when the heart is subject to increased workload, as is the case during high-intensity exercise or inotropic stimulation, we propose metabolomics studies in heart tissue and plasma, at rest and following inotrope stimulation. We anticipate that the results of these studies will allow us to move forward with further investigations into specific metabolites of interest as biomarkers, to be tested in HCM patients in future studies.

The study used a mouse model of maternal high-fat diet-induced obesity that recapitulates cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities seen in humans born to obese mothers. to compare the metabolic characteristics of bone marrow cells in newly weaned mice. The results showed that the bone marrow of offspring born to mothers on a high-fat diet primarily used glucose through OXPHOS, and presented decreased amino acid metabolism. These metabolic changes were observed in the bone marrow of the offspring at a very young age, before any symptomatic metabolic disease was present.

We demonstrate, using single-cell mass cytometry, a sub-population of endogenous human cardiac fibroblasts expressing increased levels of CD4, a helper T-cell marker, in addition to myofibroblast markers distributed in human fibrotic RV tissue, interstitial/perivascular lesions of SUGEN/Hypoxia (SuHx) rats and fibroblasts labelled with pdgfra CreERt2/+ in R26R-tdTomato mice. Recombinant IL-1ß increases IL-1R, CCR2 receptor expression, modifies the secretome, and differentiates cardiac fibroblasts to form CD68 positive cell clusters. IL-1ß also activates stemness markers such as NANOG and SOX2 and genes involved in de-differentiation, lymphoid cell function and metabolic reprogramming. IL-1ß induction of lineage traced primary mouse cardiac fibroblasts causes these cells to lose their fibroblast identity and acquire an immune phenotype. Our results identify IL-1ß induced immune-competency in human cardiac fibroblasts and suggest that fibroblast secretome modulation may constitute a therapeutic approach to PAH and other diseases typified by inflammation and fibrotic remodeling.

Altering metabolism allows cancer cells to overcome unfavorable microenvironment conditions and to increase and invade. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Genomic amplification of MYC defines a subset of poor-prognosis medulloblastoma. We performed comprehensive metabolic studies of human MYC-amplified medulloblastoma by comparing the metabolic profiles of tumor cells in three different conditions—in vitro, in flank xenografts, and orthotopic xenografts in the cerebellum. Principal component analysis showed that the metabolic profiles of brain and flank high-MYC medulloblastoma tumors clustered closely together and separated away from the normal brain and in vitro MYC-amplified cells. Compared to typical brains, MYC-amplified medulloblastoma orthotopic xenograft tumors showed upregulation of the TCA cycle and the synthesis of nucleotides, hexosamines, amino acids, and glutathione. There was significantly higher glucose uptake and usage in orthotopic xenograft tumors compared to flank xenograft tumors and cells in culture. In orthotopic tumors, glucose was the primary carbon source for the de novo synthesis of glutamate, glutamine, and glutathione through the TCA cycle. In vivo, the glutaminase II pathway was the main pathway utilizing glutamine. Glutathione was the most abundant upregulated metabolite in orthotopic tumors compared to normal brains. Glutamine-derived glutathione was synthesized through the glutamine transaminase K (GTK) enzyme in vivo. In conclusion, high MYC medulloblastoma cells have different metabolic profiles in vitro compared to in vivo, and critical vulnerabilities may be missed by not performing in vivo metabolic analyses.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001756	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8QT46			Role of cilia in mitochondrial function	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most common potentially lethal genetic disease in humans and the fourth leading cause of kidney disease, exhibits features of both a ciliary and metabolic disorder. Our previous research revealed that cells overexpressing Exoc5 with elongated cilia demonstrate enhanced recovery from oxidative stress. To investigate the connection between primary cilia and metabolism, we conducted an unbiased metabolomics screen. Global metabolic profiling was performed on canine MDCK cells (Control, Exoc5 ciliary targeting sequence mutation (CTS-mut), Exoc5 knockdown (KD), Exoc5 overexpression (OE)) and murine cells (Ift88 knockout (KO), Ift88 rescue). Knockdown (KD) or ciliary targeting sequence mutation (CTS-mut) in Exoc5, a central exocyst component, resulted in cilia loss. Similarly, Ift88 knockout (KO) resulted in cilia loss. For each experimental group, we cultivated six independent replicates of Exoc5 OE, KD, CTS-mut, and control MDCK cells, as well as six independent replicates of murine Ift88 KO and rescue cells. Cell pellets were obtained from the cultures, and we analyzed the global metabolic profiles for all 36 cell pellets. The most significant findings from the metabolomics screen indicated defects in tryptophan metabolism. This discovery suggests a potential link between primary cilia function and tryptophan-related metabolic pathways. Further exploration of these findings may shed light on the underlying mechanisms and implications for ADPKD pathogenesis and metabolic disturbances.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001757	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8M13Z			Functional GAS2 studies	Liu et al. recently reported the characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana GAS2 (Gain of Function in ABA-modulated Seed Germination 2), which was described as an enzyme that catalyzes the stereospeci?c hydration of GA12 to produce GA12 16, 17-dihydro-16?-ol (DHGA12). A second paper describes the conversion of GA12 to an unidentified product by GAS2 and also reports that this enzyme does not convert ABA. However, as previously reported, we did not find any conversion of [17-14C]-labeled or [1-,7-,12-,18-14C4]-labeled GA12 by GAS2.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001758	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8GB0P			Metabolomics panel associated with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes towards biomarker discovery	Background: The most prevalent comorbidity among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). CFRD has been linked to one of the worse clinical outcomes and higher mortality. Improved clinical results have been related to earlier diagnosis and treatment of CFRD. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the metabolome of human serum of patients with CFRD. This might aid in identifying novel biomarkers linked with the pathophysiology of CFRD and its diagnosis. Methods: The liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC–HRMS) metabolomics approach was utilized for serum samples from patients with CF (n= 36) and healthy control (n=36). Among the CF group, nine patients were with CFRD and 27 were non-CFRD (nCFRD). Results: A total of 2328 metabolites were significantly altered in CF compared to the healthy control. Among those, 799 significantly dysregulated metabolites were identified between CFRD and nCFRD. Arachidonic acid (AA), ascorbate, and aldarate metabolism were the most common metabolic pathways dysregulated in CF. L-homocysteic acid (L-HCA) levels were significantly reduced in CF and CFRD compared to control and nCFRD, respectively. In addition, gamma-glutamylglycine and L-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) had the highest discrimination between CFRD and nCFRD with AUC (0.716 and 0.683, respectively). Conclusions: These biomarkers might serve as diagnostic biomarkers and aid in understanding potential metabolic changes linked to CF and CFRD.

We analyzed mouse plasma and tissue samples from fasted mice housed at room temperature or acutely exposed to 4°C. First, C57BL/6 mice (n=41) were divided into 2 groups (n=20-21 per group) and underwent surgery to implant an indwelling arterial catheter. Mice originally housed at room temperature were housed without food for 6 hours at room temperature or 4°C, after which blood was collected from the arterial catheter and centrifuged, and plasma was collected for metabolomic analyses. Second, C57BL/6 mice (n=12) were divided into 2 groups (n=6 per group) and housed without food for 6 hours at room temperature or 4°C. Mice were euthanized, and tissues (brown adipose tissue, heart, liver, quadricepts muscle, diaphragm, and gonadal-white adipose tissue) were collected, freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen, and used for metabolomic analyses. Overall our data detail a coordinated and broad metabolic response governing the thermogenic response to acute cold exposure in mice.

However, much is yet unknown about how fetal metabolism changes during mammalian development and how altered maternal metabolism shapes fetal metabolism. Here, we present a descriptive atlas of in vivo fetal murine metabolism during mid-to-late gestation in normal and diabetic pregnancy. Using 13C-glucose and LC-MS, we profiled the metabolism of fetal brains, hearts, livers, and placentas harvested from pregnant dams between embryonic days (E)10.5 and 18.5. Comparative analysis of our large metabolomics dataset revealed metabolic features specific to fetal tissues developed under a hyperglycemic environment as well as metabolic signatures that may denote developmental transitions during euglycemic development. We observed sorbitol accumulation in fetal tissues and altered neurotransmitter levels in fetal brains isolated from dams with maternal hyperglycemia. Tracing 13C-glucose revealed disparate nutrient sourcing in fetuses depending on maternal glycemic states. Regardless of glycemic state, histidine-derived metabolites accumulated during late development in fetal tissues and maternal plasma. Our rich dataset presents a comprehensive overview of in vivo fetal tissue metabolism and alterations occurring as a result of maternal hyperglycemia.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001765	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8K128			Smoking Induced Gut Microbial Dysbiosis Mediates Cancer Progression Through Adaptive Immune System Modulation	Cigarette smoke exposure (CSE), either through active smoking or secondhand smoke, increases the risk for a plethora of cancers. Studies have estimated that one in three cancer deaths is associated with cigarette smoke exposure. However, despite ongoing research on numerous carcinogens, the underlying mechanism(s) remain poorly understood. Recent evidence indicates that the gut microbiome can influence cancer progression by immune system modulation. Since CSE alters the gut microbiome, we hypothesized that the gut microbiome serves as a causative link between smoking and cancer growth. Through a combination of rigorous syngeneic animal models and fecal microbiome transplantation studies, we establish an essential role for smoke-induced dysbiosis in cancer growth. Using Flow cytometric analysis of tumor specimens and experiments in Rag 1 KO and CD8 KO, we demonstrate that smoke induced tumor growth requires functional adaptive immunity. We further characterized the unique gut microbial and metabolomic signatures induced by CSE using high throughput 16s rRNA sequencing and mass spectrometric techniques. Finally, utilizing gut microbial ablation strategies with broad and narrow-spectrum antibiotics, we demonstrate the reversal of phenotypic effects of CSE and present a novel actionable target to mitigate CSE-induced tumor promotion.

Previous proteomics and metabolomics studies conducted in blood samples collected from FMR1 premutation carriers with FXTAS reported abnormalities in energy metabolism, and precursors of gluconeogenesis showed significant changes in plasma expression levels in FMR1 premutation carriers who developed FXTAS. We conducted an analysis of postmortem human brain tissues from 44 donors, 25 brains with FXTAS, and 19 matched controls. We quantified the metabolite relative abundance in the inferior temporal gyrus and the cerebellum using untargeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics. We investigated how the metabolite type and abundance relate to the number of cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeats, to markers of neurodegeneration, and to the symptoms of FXTAS.

In murine BAT, cold increases the fundamental molecule for mitochondrial function, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), but limited knowledge on NAD+ metabolism during cold in human BAT metabolism exists. We show that cold increases the serum metabolites of the NAD+ salvage pathway (nicotinamide and 1-methylnicotinamide) in humans. Additionally, individuals with coldstimulated BAT activation have decreased levels of metabolites from the de novo NAD+ biosynthesis pathway (tryptophan, kynurenine). Serum nicotinamide correlates positively with cold-stimulated BAT activation, whereas tryptophan and kynurenine correlates negatively. Furthermore, the expression of genes involved in NAD+ biosynthesis in BAT are related to markers of metabolic health. Our data indicate that cold increases serum tryptophan conversion to nicotinamide to be further utilized by BAT. We conclude that NAD+ metabolism is activated upon cold in humans and probably regulated in a coordinated fashion by several tissues.

Lactation has substantial effects on mother’s metabolism and VA is required in multiple biological processes, including growth, vision, immunity, and reproduction. The objective of this pilot study was to utilize metabolomics profiling to conduct a broad, exploratory assessment of differences in plasma metabolites associated with low VA status versus VA adequacy in lactating women. Plasma samples from lactating women who participated in a survey in Samar, Philippines, were selected from a cross-sectional study based on plasma retinol concentrations indicating low (VA-; n=5) or adequate (VA+; n=5) VA status (plasma retinol <0.8 or >1.05 µmol/L). The plasma results collected from six metabolomics assays (oxylipins, endocannabinoids, bile acids, primary metabolomics, biogenic amines, and lipidomics) were compared by group using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Twenty-eight metabolites were altered in the VA- versus VA+ status groups, with 24 being lipid mediators (p<0.05). These lipid mediators included lower concentrations of arachidonic acid- and eicosapentaenoic acid-derived oxylipins, as well as lysophospholipids and sphingolipids, in the VA- group (p<0.05). Chemical similarity enrichment analysis identified HETEs, HEPEs, and DiHETEs as significantly altered oxylipin clusters (p<0.0001, false discovery rate (FDR) p<0.0001), as well as sphingomyelins, saturated lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, and phosphatidylethanolamines (p<0.001, FDR p<0.01). The multi-assay nutritional metabolomics profiling of low VA status compared with adequacy in lactating women was characterized by reduced lipid mediator concentrations. Future studies with stronger study designs and larger sample size are needed to confirm and validate these preliminary results.

Herein we performed the analysis of the pre-nodal mesenteric lymph at steady state and following disruption of the intestinal barrier to map the antigenic and pro-inflammatory load in both mice and human subjects with inflammatory bowel disease. The antigenic signature of gastrointestinal tissue inflammation was reflected in the mesenteric nodal dendritic-cells (DC)-MHCII-eluted immunopeptidome, in a tissue specific manner, when compared to the DC-eluted-MHCII-peptidome from cervical lymph nodes. Pro-inflammatory and microbiome-derived by-products, such as amino acids, deoxy sugars, component of the bacterial wall and other immunomodulators of the gut-brain axis, were found in the afferent lymph following damage to the gut epithelium. Our data points to the relevance of the lymphatic fluid to probe the tissue-specific antigenic and inflammatory load transported to the draining lymph node.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001771	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8SM6H			Nucleotide, phospholipid, and kynurenine metabolites are robustly associated with COVID-19 severity and time of plasma sample collection in a prospective cohort study	Introduction: A deep understanding of the molecular underpinnings of disease severity and progression in large human studies is necessary to develop metabolism-related preventive strategies of severe disease outcomes, particularly in viral pandemics like that of COVID-19. The use of samples collected before disease diagnosis, however, is limited and thus metabolites and metabolic pathways that predispose to severe disease are not well understood. Further, current studies are limited in sample size, number of metabolites evaluated, and/or do not adjust for comorbidities. Methods: We generated comprehensive plasma metabolomic profiles in more than 600 patients from the Longitudinal EMR and Omics COVID-19 Cohort (LEOCC). Samples were collected before (n = 441), during (n = 86), and after (n = 82) COVID-19 diagnosis. Regression models were used to determine (1) metabolites associated with predisposition to and/or persistent effects of COVID-19 severity within each time of sample collection, using logistic regression and (2) metabolites associated with time of sample collection, using linear regression, to better understand transient or lingering metabolic alterations over the disease course. All models were controlled for demographic (age, sex, race, ethnicity), risk (smoking status, BMI), and comorbidities (Charlson Index). Metabolites with an FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered significant. Results: Of the 1,546 metabolites measured, 506 were associated with disease severity or time of sample collection. Among these, sphingolipids and phospholipids were negatively associated with severity and exhibited lingering elevations after disease, while modified nucleotides were positively associated with severity and had lingering decreases after disease. Cytidine and uridine metabolites, which were positively and negatively associated with COVID-19 severity, respectively, were transiently elevated in active disease, reflecting particular importance of pyrimidine metabolism in active COVID-19. Conclusions: We identified novel metabolites reflecting predisposition to severe disease and changes to global metabolism from before to during and after COVID-19 diagnosis. This is the first large metabolomics study using COVID-19 plasma samples before, during, and/or after disease. This study lays the groundwork for identifying putative clinical biomarkers and identifying preventative strategies for severe disease outcomes.

ROP is a leading cause of blindness in children worldwide. Amino acid metabolism is altered in preterm infants. In this study, pups were daily injected with streptozotocin from P1 to P10 to induce hyperglycemia-associated retinopathy. L-isoleucine or PBS control was injected intraperitoneally from P7 to P10.

Erythroid cells harbor a unique sensitivity to folate deprivation, as revealed by the primary pathological manifestation of nutritional folate deprivation: megaloblastic anemia. To study this metabolic sensitivity, we applied mild folate depletion to human and mouse erythroid cell lines, and primary murine erythroid progenitors. We show that folate depletion induces early blockade of purine synthesis and accumulation of the purine synthesis intermediate and signaling molecule, AICAR, followed by enhanced heme metabolism, hemoglobin synthesis, and erythroid differentiation. This is phenocopied by inhibition of folate metabolism using the SHMT1/2 inhibitor - SHIN1, and by AICAR supplementation. Mechanistically, the metabolically-driven differentiation is independent of nucleotide sensing through mTORC1 and AMPK, and is instead mediated by protein kinase C (PKC). Our findings suggest that folate deprivation-induced premature differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells is a molecular etiology to folate-deficiency induced anemia.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001774	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8DB1F			Resource competition predicts assembly of in vitro gut bacterial communities	Microbiota dynamics arise from a plethora of interspecies interactions, including resource competition, cross-feeding, and pH modulation. The individual contributions of these mechanisms are challenging to untangle, especially in natural or complex laboratory environments where the landscape of resource competition is unclear. Here, we developed a framework to estimate the extent of multi-species niche overlaps by combining metabolomics data of individual species, growth measurements in pairwise spent media, and mathematical models. When applied to an in vitro model system of human gut commensals in complex media, our framework revealed that a simple model of resource competition described most pairwise interactions. By grouping metabolomic features depleted by the same set of species, we constructed a coarse-grained consumer-resource model that predicted assembly compositions to reasonable accuracy. Moreover, deviations from model predictions enabled us to identify and incorporate into the model additional interactions, including pH-mediated effects and cross-feeding, which improved model performance. In sum, our work provides an experimental and theoretical framework to dissect microbial interactions in complex in vitro environments.

However, the depth and duration of responses are often limited. Here, we conducted integrative transcriptomics, metabolomics, and phosphoproteomics analysis of patient-derived models to define the pathways that fuel tumor growth downstream of oncogenic FGFR2 signaling in ICC and to uncover compensatory mechanisms associated with pathway inhibition. We find FGFR2-mediated activation of NF-kB maintains a highly glycolytic phenotype. Conversely, FGFR inhibition blocks glucose uptake and glycolysis while inciting a series of adaptive changes, including switching fuel source utilization to favor fatty acid oxidation and increasing mitochondrial fusion and autophagy. Accordingly, FGFR inhibitor efficacy is potentiated by combined mitochondrial targeting, an effect enhanced in xenograft models by intermittent fasting. Thus, we show that oncogenic FGFR2 signaling drives NF-kB-dependent glycolysis in ICC and that metabolic reprogramming in response to FGFR inhibition confers new targetable vulnerabilities.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001776	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M84T59			Bacterial tryptophan metabolites increased by prebiotic galactooligosaccharide reduce microglial reactivity and are associated with lower anxiety-like behavior	Prebiotic galactooligosaccharides (GOS) reduce anxiety-like behaviors in mice and humans. However, the biological pathways behind these behavioral changes are not well understood. To begin to study these pathways, C57BL/6 mice were fed a standard diet with or without GOS supplementation for 3 weeks prior to testing on the open field. After behavioral testing, colonic contents and serum were collected for bacteriome (16S rRNA gene sequencing, colonic contents only) and metabolome (UPLC-MS, colonic contents and serum data) analyses. As expected, GOS significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior (i.e., increased time in the center (p &lt; 0.05)). Time in the center was significantly correlated with serum methyl-indole-3-acetate (mI3A). This metabolite, which is a methylated form of indole-3-acetate, is derived from bacterial metabolism of tryptophan. Sequencing analyses showed that GOS significantly increased Akkermansia, which is known to metabolize both GOS and tryptophan. To test the hypothesis that mI3A can reduce anxiety-like behavior and affect microglial activity, we first tested mI3A effects on LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia. Cells treated with mI3A produced significantly less CCL2 and TNF-? than vehicle-treated cells (p&lt;.05). We then treated mice with an intraperitoneal injection of mI3A or vehicle control, and found that mice given mI3A had lower CCL2 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, as well as a reduction in a composite behavioral score in the open field. Together, these data support a novel pathway through which GOS reduces anxiety-like behaviors in mice, and suggests that the bacterial metabolite mI3A, which is elevated by GOS, reduces microglial CCL2, which in turn reduces anxiety-like behavior.

Mitochondria, peroxisomes, Golgi, and ER all exchange fatty acids to allow for specialised processing and subsequent use by each specific organelle. While these processes suggest inter-organellar dependency for cell functions, the nature of this interconnection and the implications for cell metabolism have yet to be elucidated. To address this knowledge gap, performed a whole-genome screen for mitochondrial stress and established knockout cell lines for genes highlighted in the screen that are important for the biogenesis of peroxisomes, Golgi, and the ER. The comprehensive lipidomics analysis on the wild-type and five knockout CAL51 cell lines illustrating that dysfunction of a single organelle induces a cell-wide network of organelle dysfunctions. Finally, we show that a specific class of lipids can repair the mitochondrial network in cells with different organelle biogenesis defects.

In order to unravel this, comparisons between temporal metabolic profiles in the plasma samples of methylprednisolone (MP) - and placebo-treated COVID-19 patients were performed at different time points. The patient plasma samples used were obtained from a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase IIb clinical trial performed on severe COVID-19 patients in the Brazilian Amazon where the patients received placebo or 0.5 mg/kg MP intravenously twice daily for five days. The MP treatment reduced the number of metabolites in the plasma of patients during follow-up. The longitudinal changes in the MP-group was in eight metabolic pathways related to steroid hormones and eicosanoids. Direct comparison between the two groups, revealed differences at baseline, which peaked five days after initiation of MP treatment. The metabolic pathways differing between the two groups over time included galactose metabolism, glucose and gluconeogenesis, N-glycan metabolism, and prostaglandin formation from arachidonate. Deoxy-galactose, prostaglandin H2, sphingosine, and sphinganine exhibited differential trajectories by day 14 after initiating the MP treatment. Survival of MP-treated COVID-19 patients was associated with modulation of tryptophan metabolism. Network analysis revealed that MP treatment is highly associated with alterations in pathways reflecting eicosanoid metabolism, such as arachidonic acid and prostaglandins. Curiously, there is crosstalk between metabolomics, biochemistry and cytokine components. Treatment of systemic and inflammatory conditions induced by SARS-CoV-2 viral infections with methylprednisolone modulates metabolic activity associated with tryptophan and inflammatory lipids.

We report that ApoE serves as a metabolic rheostat that regulates microRNA-control of glycolytic and mitochondrial activity in myeloid cells and hematopoietic stem & progenitor cells (HSPCs). ApoE expression in myeloid cells increases microRNA-146a, which reduces NF-?B-driven GLUT1 expression and glycolytic activity. In contrast, ApoE expression reduces microRNA-142a, which increases CPT1A expression, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. Improved mitochondrial metabolism by ApoE expression causes an enrichment of TCA cycle metabolites and NAD+ in macrophages. The study of mice with conditional ApoE expression supports the capacity for ApoE to foster microRNA-controlled immunometabolism. Modulation of microRNA-146a & -142a in the hematopoietic system of hyperlipidemic mice using RNA mimics & antagonists, respectively, improves mitochondrial metabolism, which suppresses inflammation and hematopoiesis. Our findings unveil an RNA regulatory network, controlled by ApoE, which exerts metabolic control over hematopoiesis and inflammation in hyperlipidemia.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells utilize glutamine (Gln) to support proliferation and redox balance. Earlier attempts to inhibit Gln metabolism using glutaminase inhibitors resulted in rapid metabolic reprogramming and therapeutic resistance. We demonstrated that treating PDAC cells with a Gln antagonist, 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), led to a metabolic crisis in vitro. In addition, we observed a profound decrease in tumor growth in various in vivo models using DRP-104 (sirpiglenastat), a pro-drug version of DON designed to circumvent DON-associated toxicity.

Here we developed a lipidomics platform that detected &gt; 2000 distinct lipids in cellular CD1 complexes, demonstrating a broad display of self-sphingolipids and phospholipids to T cells. The four types of human CD1 antigen presenting molecules show differing lipid capture motifs based on the length and chemical structures of lipids bound, pointing to general self-lipid capture mechanisms. For CD1a and CD1d, lipid size matches CD1 cleft volume, whereas CD1b shows a nearly universal size mismatch with its ligands, which results from the uniform seating of two small lipids within its large cleft. Further, the list of compounds that comprise the assembled CD1 lipidomes provides a resource for matching to bioactive lipids from other fields of research and supports the ongoing discovery of lipid blockers and antigens for T cells.

Bone formation is not suppressed, however, when bone degradation is reduced by retarding osteoclast functional resorptive capacity, rather than differentiation. We find deletion of deubiquitinase, BRCA1-associated protein 1 (Bap1), in myeloid cells (Bap1?LysM), arrests osteoclast function but not formation. Bap1?LysM osteoclasts fail to organize their cytoskeleton which is essential for bone degradation. Consequently, bone mass increases in the mutant mice. We find the deubiquitinase activity of Bap1 regulates osteoclast function by metabolic reprogramming. Bap1 deficient osteoclast lineage cells upregulate the cystine transporter, Slc7a11, by enhanced H2Aub occupancy of its promoter. SLC7A11 regulates cellular ROS levels and redirects the mitochondrial metabolites away from the TCA cycle, both of which are necessary for osteoclast function. Thus in osteoclasts, Bap1 appears to regulate epigenetic-metabolic axis and is a potential target to reduce bone degradation while maintaining osteogenesis in osteoporotic patients.

This finding was substantiated by analyzing RNA-seq data from a considerable number of patient metastases across various cancer types.

While many tumors initially respond to AR inhibition, nearly all develop resistance. It is critical to understand how prostate tumor cells respond to AR inhibition in order to exploit therapy-induced phenotypes prior to the outgrowth of treatment-resistant disease. Here, we comprehensively characterize the effect of AR blockade on prostate cancer metabolism using transcriptomics, metabolomics and bioenergetics approaches. The metabolic response to AR inhibition is defined by reduced glycolysis, robust elongation of mitochondria, and increased reliance on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. We establish DRP1 activity and MYC signaling as mediators of AR blockade-induced metabolic phenotypes. Rescuing DRP1 phosphorylation after AR inhibition restores mitochondrial fission, while rescuing MYC restores glycolytic activity and prevents sensitivity to complex I inhibition. Our study provides new insight into the regulation of treatment-induced metabolic phenotypes and vulnerabilities in prostate cancer.

The dimensionality of collision cross section (CCS) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for feature annotation has become a useful tool for high confidence structural elucidation in complex mixtures in the absence of authentic standards. A comprehensive method for feature identification of small organisms has remained limited to exploring genetic markers and protein signatures, however these methods for identification only scratch the surface of effective methods for bacterial classification. Multi-omic methods that include the metabolome and lipidome have grown in popularity due to the increased capacity for organism specific information. We have achieved species-level identification of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using a modern single-phase extraction method with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled to traveling wave ion mobility mass spectrometry (TWIMS). To test the robustness of this optimized workflow, we included internal standards as a metric for efficiency of the extraction, and well known calibrants for validation for our CCS calibration method. We observed significant differences in metabolite profiles at the strain level using multi-variate statistics, primarily including quorum sensing metabolites in Gram-negative strains, and energy production metabolites in the Gram-positive strains. Lipid profiles showed staggering differences in acyl tail compositions that effectively categorized the microbes, including several classes of phospholipids and glycolipids. We have demonstrated a powerful workflow using multi-dimensional techniques for bacterial speciation in a single injection.

We report the analysis of 1 year of data from the first cohort of 15 patients from two trial sites that received increasing numbers of allogeneic hNSCs delivered via intracerebroventricular injection in combination with an immunosuppressive regimen. No treatment-related deaths nor serious adverse events (AEs) were observed over the 12-month follow-up. Participants displayed stability of clinical and laboratory parameters, as well as lesion load and activity at the brain MRIs, compared to study entry. Longitudinal metabolomics and lipidomics analyses of cerebrospinal fluid and serum from these patients identified time and dose-dependent responses, with increased levels of free fatty acids and acylcarnitines in the CSF, especially at the highest dose of injected hNSCs at the one-year follow-up time point. Finally, a significant inverse correlation was found between the highest dose of injected hNSCs and the smaller parenchymal brain volume change (PBVC; Spearman’s rho= -0.7, p= 0.03), clinical covariates that correlated with CSF levels of free fatty acids, acyl-carnitines, oxylipins, conjugated bile acids and purine breakdown and deamination products, such as hypoxanthine. The absence of AEs and the stability of functional and structural outcomes is reassuring in terms of risks and represent a main milestone to rigorously address the challenges for the safe translation of key principles of stem cell biology into effective regenerative medicines.

Despite its role as a commensal, SE has emerged as an opportunistic pathogen, associated with 80% of medical devices related infections. Moreover, these bacteria are extremely difficult to treat due to their ability to form biofilms and accumulate resistance to almost all classes of antimicrobials developed so far. Thus new preventive and therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. In spite of its clinical importance, the molecular mechanisms associated with SE colonisation and disease are still poorly understood. A deeper understanding of the metabolic and cellular processes associated with response to environmental factors characteristic of SE ecological niches in health and disease might provide new clues on colonisation and disease processes. Here we studied the impact of pH conditions, mimicking the skin pH (5.5) and blood pH (7.4), in a S. epidermidis pathogenic strain, belonging to the A/C clonal lineage, by means of next-generation proteomics and 1H NMR-based metabolomics. Moreover, we evaluated the metabolic changes occurring when a sudden pH change arise, simulating the skin barrier break produced by a catheter.

However, the FA heart maintains adequate function until disease end stage, suggesting that it can initially adapt to the loss of frataxin (FXN). Conditional knockout mouse models with no Fxn expression show transcriptional and metabolic profiles of cardiomyopathy and mitochondrial integrated stress response (ISRmt). However, ISRmt has not been investigated in models with disease-relevant, partial decrease of FXN. We characterized the heart transcriptomes and metabolomes of three mouse models of partial FXN loss, YG8-800, KIKO-700, and FxnG127V. Few metabolites were significantly changed in YG8-800 mice and did not provide a signature of cardiomyopathy or ISRmt. Instead, several metabolites were altered in FxnG127V and KIKO-700 hearts. Transcriptional changes were found in all models, but differentially expressed genes consistent with cardiomyopathy and ISRmt were only identified in FxnG127V hearts. However, these changes were surprisingly mild even at an advanced age (18-months), despite a severe decrease in FXN levels to 1% of WT. These findings indicate that the mouse heart has extremely low reliance on FXN, highlighting the difficulty in modeling genetically relevant FA cardiomyopathy.

Sphingolipids metabolism disorders are associated with the occurrence and development of AAA. It has been discovered that ganglioside GM3, a sialic acid-containing type of glycosphingolipid, plays a protective role in atherosclerosis which is an important risk factor for AAA, but the potential contribution of GM3 to AAA development has not been investigated. Methods: We performed a metabolomics study to evaluated GM3 level in plasma of human AAA patients. We profiled GM3 synthase (ST3GAL5) expression in the mouse model of aneurysm and human AAA tissues through western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. RNA sequencing, proteomic analysis, affinity purification and mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, and functional studies were used to dissect the molecular mechanism of GM3-regulating ferroptosis. We conditionally deleted and overexpressed St3gal5 in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in vivo to investigate its role in AAA. Results: We found significantly reduced plasma levels of the GM3 in human AAA patients. GM3 content and ST3GAL5 expression were all decreased in abdominal aortic VSMCs in AAA patients and mouse model. RNA-sequencing analysis showed that ST3GAL5 silencing in human aortic SMCs (HASMCs) induced ferroptosis. Importantly, we showed that GM3 interacted directly with the extracellular domain of transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1), a cell membrane protein critical for cellular iron uptake, disrupted its interaction with holo-transferrin. SMC-specific St3gal5 knockout exacerbated iron accumulation at lesion sites and significantly promoted AAA development, while GM3 supplementation suppressed lipid peroxidation, reduced iron deposition in aortic VSMCs and markedly decreased AAA incidence. Conclusions: Together, these results suggest that GM3 dysregulation promotes ferroptosis of VSMCs in AAA. Furthermore, GM3 may constitute a new therapeutic target for the treatment of AAA.

Undergoing a series of biopsies for monitoring disease progression and treatments is unlikely suitable for patients with LN. Thus, there is an urgent need for non-invasive alternative biomarkers that can facilitate LN class diagnosis. Such biomarkers will be very useful in guiding intervention strategies to mitigate or treat patients with LN. Urine samples were collected from two independent cohorts. Patients with LN were classified into proliferative (class III/IV) and membranous (class V) by kidney histopathology. Metabolomics was performed to identify potential metabolites, which could be specific for the classification of membranous LN. The ratio of picolinic acid (Pic) to tryptophan (Trp) ([Pic/Trp] ratio) was found to be a promising candidate for LN diagnostic and membranous classification. It has high potential as an alternative biomarker for the non-invasive diagnosis of LN.

Its dysfunction is associated with many cancers and immune/neurological disorders. Here, we apply native mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches to provide evidence of super-dimer formation (LAT1-4F2hc)2. When combined with lipidomics, and site-directed mutagenesis, we discover four endogenous phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecules at the interface and C-terminus of both LAT1 subunits. We find that interfacial PE binding is regulated by 4F2hc-R183 and is critical for regulation of palmitoylation on neighbouring LAT1-C187. Combining native MS with mass photometry (MP) we reveal that super-dimerization is sensitive to pH, and modulated by complex N-glycans on the 4F2hc subunit. Free LAT1 is also present in the lysosome after interferon-? (IFN-?) stimulation suggesting that the assembly of LAT1-4F2hc is regulated by redox dynamics in vivo. Together our results link PTM and lipid binding with regulation and trafficking of the LAT1-4F2hc super dimer.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001798	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M89D97			High Level Expression of NSD2 Creates a Metabolic Dependency in Multiple Myeloma	Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of plasma cells with several molecular subtypes and variable prognosis. Despite therapeutic advances, most patients ultimately relapse due to drug resistance. Frontline treatments for MM target malignant cells based on their differentiated B cell nature, but not the underlying genetic lesions. Chromosomal translocation t(4;14), observed in 15% of MM patients, results in overexpression of the histone methyltransferase NSD2, which contributes to MM pathogenesis by promoting an oncogenic transcriptional program and is associated with a worse prognosis. A genome-wide CRISPR based functional screen in isogenic MM cell lines with high and low NSD2 expression identified the mitochondrial enzyme adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) as a NSD2-driven MM cell dependency. AK2 loss in t(4;14) MM cells induced apoptosis and inhibited cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with a defect in shuttling ATP from the mitochondria to intracellular utilization sites, AK2 depletion impaired ATP-dependent protein folding in the ER and increased MM cell sensitivity to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Furthermore, AK2 suppression decreased intracellular NAD(H) phosphorylation resulting in lower NADP(H) levels. Cytosolic NADPH is necessary for reducing thioredoxin, an essential cofactor for ribonucleotide reductase which is critical for deoxyribonucleotides (dNTP) synthesis. Consequently, AK2 deficiency in MM cells resulted in dNTP pool depletion and induced DNA replication stress. Creatine phosphorylation by mitochondrial creatine kinase is an alternative route for shuttling ATP from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Metabolomics analysis revealed decreased levels of creatine and accumulation of its precursor guanadoacetate in NSD2 high cells, in association with elevated levels of S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) indicating consumption of the carbon donor S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM). This along with the 6-fold increase in genome wide H3K36me2 levels and 40% increase in DNA methylation levels in NSD2 high cells suggested that overexpression of NSD2 redirected one-carbon metabolism to the epigenome and away from the SAM-dependent creatine synthesis. Therefore, decreased creatine levels in NSD2 overexpressing cells underlie the increased reliance on AK2. Correspondingly, supplementation with exogenous creatine restored NADP(H) levels and rescued AK2 deficient cells from apoptosis. These findings revealed a novel metabolic susceptibility in t(4;14) MM and provided insight into a novel therapeutic strategy to improve patient prognosis.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001799	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85M79			Exogenous L-Alanine promotes phagocytosis via dual regulations of TLR4 to eliminate multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens	Multidrug-resistant bacteria present a major threat to public health. Therefore, new drugs or approaches are urgently needed to manage and mitigate this threat. Here, we screen the molecular candidates that allow the survival of mice upon multidrug-resistant Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection by integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis, where L-Alanine metabolism and phagocytosis are highly correlated. The role of L-Alanine on boosting mouse survival is further confirmed with in vivo bacterial challenge studies on multidrug-resistant bacteria including V. parahaemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Functional studies demonstrate that exogenous L-Alanine promotes phagocytosis to these different species of multidrug-resistant pathogens. The underlying mechanism involves two events that are L-Alanine-dependently increased TLR4 expression, and L-Alanine-enhanced TLR4 signaling via increasing the biosynthesis and secretion of fatty acids such as palmitate. Palmitate enhances the binding of LPS to TLR4 and thereby promotes TLR4 dimmer formation and endocytosis for the subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt and NF-?B pathways and phagocytosis of bacteria. These results suggest that modulation of metabolic environment is a plausible approach for combating infection with multidrug-resistant bacteria.

However, because it is challenging to control the proportion and regiospecificity of deuterium incorporation in live systems, often only two or three synthetic lipids are mixed together to form simplistic model membranes. This limits the applicability and biological accuracy of the results generated with these synthetic membranes. Despite some limited prior examination of deuterating E. coli lipids in vivo, this approach has not been widely implemented. Here, an extensive mass spectrometry-based profiling of E. coli phospholipid deuteration states with several different growth media was performed and a computational method to describe deuterium distributions with a one-number summary is introduced. The deuteration states of thirty-six lipid species were quantitatively profiled in fifteen different growth conditions and tandem mass spectrometry was used to reveal deuterium localization. Regressions were employed to enable the prediction of lipid deuteration for untested conditions. Small-angle neutron scattering was performed on select deuterated lipid samples, which validated the deuteration states calculated from the mass spectral data. Based on these experiments, guidelines for the design of specifically deuterated phospholipids are described. This unlocks even greater capabilities from neutron-based techniques, enabling experiments that were formerly impossible.

However, the role of glutamine metabolism in regulating cardiac remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI) is unknown. In this study, we show that glutamine metabolism is altered both in the remote (contractile) area and in infiltrating macrophages in the infarct area after MI in adult male mice by permanent left anterior descending artery occlusion. Using untargeted metabolomics in extracted LV macrophages, we found that metabolites related to glutamine metabolism were differentially altered at days 1, 3, and 7 after MI. Glutamine metabolism in live cells was found to be increased after MI relative to no MI controls. Gene expression in the remote area of the heart indicated a loss of glutamine metabolism. Glutamine administration improved LV function at days 1, 3, and 7, which was associated with improved contractile and metabolic gene expression.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001806	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M88F0V			Quantitative analysis of nutrient metabolite compositions of retail cow’s milk and milk alternatives in Thailand using GC-MS	To provide comprehensive metabolite profiles and their concentrations, this study characterized retail cow’s milk and plant-based milk (soymilk and almond milk) for amino acids (AA), fatty acids (FA), and sugars. The cow’s milk samples included conventional milk with different heating processes and lactose-free cow’s milk. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify pattern associated with different types of milk. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the plant-based milk alternatives were markedly different from cow’s milk samples. This was attributed mainly to FA, particularly C18:2n-6 and C18:1 (cis-9) which were highest in soymilk and almond milk, respectively. Unlike the cow’s milk samples, the plant-based milk samples exhibited greater brand-to-brand variation in metabolite concentrations. The mean concentration of total AA in soymilk samples was comparable to that in cow’s milk samples, but the cow’s milk samples were 1.4–6.3 times more enriched in branched-chain AA. There was no significant difference in AA and FA concentrations between conventional and lactose-free cow’s milk. Heating processes of cow’s milk did not result in distinct metabolite patterns. This study further showed that FA profiling could be applied to evaluating soymilk adulteration with 1 %–2 % cow’s milk.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001807	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M84Q6N			A metabolomics pipeline highlights microbial metabolism in bloodstream infections	The growth of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) highlights an urgent need to identify bacterial pathogenic functions that may be targets for clinical intervention. Although severe infections profoundly alter host metabolism, prior studies have largely ignored microbial metabolism in this context. Here we describe an iterative, comparative metabolomics pipeline to uncover microbial metabolic features in the complex setting of a host and apply it to investigate gram-negative bloodstream infection (BSI) in patients. The data from each stage of this analysis pipeline are included here. We find elevated levels of bacterially-derived acetylated polyamines during BSI and discover the enzyme responsible for their production (SpeG). Blocking SpeG activity reduces bacterial proliferation and slows pathogenesis. Reduction of SpeG activity also enhances bacterial membrane permeability and increases intracellular antibiotic accumulation, allowing us to overcome AMR in culture and in vivo. This study highlights how tools to study pathogen metabolism in the natural context of infection can reveal and prioritize new therapeutic strategies for addressing challenging infections.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001809	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8W71R			Plasma metabolomics reveals distinct biological and diagnostic signatures for melioidosis	Rationale: The global burden of sepsis is greatest in low-resource settings. Melioidosis, infection with the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is a frequent cause of fatal sepsis in endemic tropical regions such as Southeast Asia. Objectives: To investigate whether plasma metabolomics would identify biological pathways specific to melioidosis and yield clinically meaningful biomarkers. Methods: Using a comprehensive approach, differential enrichment of plasma metabolites and pathways was systematically evaluated in individuals selected from a prospective cohort of patients hospitalized in rural Thailand with infection. Statistical and bioinformatics methods were used to distinguish metabolomic features and processes specific to melioidosis patients, and between fatal and non-fatal cases. Measurements and Main Results: Metabolomic profiling and pathway enrichment analysis of plasma samples of melioidosis (n=175) and non-melioidosis infections (n=75) revealed a distinct immuno-metabolic state among patients with melioidosis, as suggested by excessive tryptophan catabolism in the kynurenine pathway and significantly increased levels of sphingomyelins and ceramide species. We derived a 12-metabolite classifier to distinguish melioidosis from other infections, yielding an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 in a second validation set of patients. Melioidosis non-survivors (n=94) had a significantly disturbed metabolome compared to survivors (n=81) with increased leucine, isoleucine and valine metabolism, and elevated circulating free fatty acids and acylcarnitines. A limited 8-metabolite panel showed promise as an early prognosticator of mortality in melioidosis. Conclusions: Melioidosis induces a distinct metabolomic state that can be examined to distinguish underlying pathophysiological mechanisms associated with death. A twelve-metabolite signature accurately differentiates melioidosis from other infections and may have diagnostic applications.

UHPLC-QTOF-MS is a rapid, sensitive, high-resolution mass spectrometry technology that detects and identifies fragment patterns of compounds in complex samples. This analysis would unravel the key metabolites modified due to RelA overexpression, thus highlighting the altered signaling pathways behind the aggressiveness and chemoresistance of TNBC through NF-?B alteration.

However, annotating the wide variety of lipid species in biological samples remains challenging in untargeted lipidomic studies. In this work, we present an optimized lipid annotation workflow based on the combination of LC-MS and MS/MS strategies, four bioinformatic tools, and a decision-tree-based approach to support the accurate annotation and semi-quantification of the lipid species present in lung tissue from control mice. The developed workflow allowed us to generate a lipid lung-based ATLAS (LiLA), which was then employed to unveil the lipidomic signatures of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection at two different time points for a deeper understanding of the disease progression. This workflow, combined with manual inspection strategies of MS/MS data, can enhance the annotation process for lipidomic studies and guide the generation of sample-specific lipidome maps. LiLA serves as a freely available data resource that can be employed in future studies to address lipidomic alterations in mice lung tissue.

Characterized by enlarged and dysfunctional adipose tissue, it is often associated with the development of metabolic or cardiovascular comorbidities. A sound understanding of the processes underlying adipogenesis, the differentiation of a preadipocyte into a mature and lipid-laden adipocyte, provide the basic knowledge for future research on the causes and consequences of obesity. The tricarboxylic acid cycle represents the central metabolic hub, that provides energy equivalents, metabolic building blocks and critical intermediates such as acetyl-CoA as precursor for protein acetylation and de novo lipogenesis. Stable cell lines are an integral part of research into the development and physiology of adipocytes in health and disease and various models have been used to date. In this study we demonstrated the vivid temporal dynamics of central carbon metabolites during the differentiation of SGBS and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Detected metabolite levels showed distinct temporal profiles, partly with cell-line specificities.

In plants, many PAMP-induced signaling pathways and cellular responses are known, yet how PTI limits pathogen growth is poorly understood. Through a combined metabolomics and genetics approach, we discovered that plant-exuded proline is a virulence-inducing signal and nutrient for the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, and that PAMP-induced depletion of proline from the extracellular spaces of Arabidopsis leaves directly contributes to PTI against P. syringae. We further show that PAMP-induced depletion of extracellular proline requires the amino acid transporter Lysine Histidine Transporter 1 (LHT1). This study demonstrates that depletion of a single extracellular metabolite is an effective component of plant immunity. Given the important role for amino acids as N and C sources for microbial growth, their depletion at sites of infection may be a broadly effective defense against many pathogens.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001814	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M87D9M			MINCH causes metabolic rewiring towards lipid accumulation and adipogenesis	Humans are ubiquitously exposed to plastic additives, including plasticizers. There is growing evidence that exposure to certain plasticizers is associated with the development of obesity due to their metabolism-disrupting properties. Following the restriction of the use of the phthalate plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) due to its adverse health effects, it has been replaced by new substitutes such as the plasticizer diisononylcyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (DINCH). Despite recent studies suggesting that the primary metabolite monoisononylcyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid ester (MINCH) promotes human adipocyte differentiation, the adipogenic properties of MINCH remain controversial. Because the metabolome largely reflects the molecular phenotype and is sensitive to perturbation by external factors, we used targeted metabolomics to investigate the effects of DINCH and MINCH on key metabolic pathways of adipocytes. Analysis of central carbon metabolism is particularly relevant because it provides cellular energy through the degradation of organic compounds and metabolic precursors for anabolic functions that are critical for adipocyte function, such as de novo lipogenesis. The project consists of three main studies: analysis of the effects of DINCH and MINCH on central carbon metabolism of human SGSB cells, analysis of the insulin response of DINCH- and MINCH-treated SGSB cells, and analysis of the effects of DINCH and MINCH on central carbon metabolism of human SGSB cells in the presence of the PPARG inhibitor GW9662.

Furthermore, metabolic changes in NTM-PD have not yet been investigated. The identification of specific metabolites and associated metabolic pathways unique to NTM-PD will provide a deeper understanding of its pathogenesis. In this study, we aimed to discover specific metabolic biomarkers for NTM-PD using a metabolomics approach. In this study, we underwent untargeted metabolomic profiling using a liquid chromatography system coupled with the quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer to analyze serum samples from patients with NTM-PD (n = 50), patients with non-NTM bronchiectasis (n = 50), and HC subjects (n = 60). To validate the results, an additional 86 serum samples for each group were analyzed using the same analytical methods. We identified several NTM-PD significant metabolites that differentiate patients with NTM-PD from healthy individuals. The machine learning-based classification model demonstrated the proficiency of the selected metabolic features in distinguishing between patients with NTM-PD and healthy individuals. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of NTM-PD and provide insights for the development of novel treatment approaches.

Cellular BNIP3 and NIX levels are tightly controlled by SCFFBXL4-mediated ubiquitination to prevent excessive mitophagy and lethal disease. Here we report that knockout of PPTC7, a mitochondrial matrix protein, hyperactivates BNIP3/NIX-mediated mitophagy in vitro and in vivo. Biochemically, the PPTC7 precursor is trapped by BNIP3 and NIX to mitochondrial outer-membrane, where PPTC7 scaffolds the assembly of the substrate-PPTC7-SCFFBXL4 holocomplex to degrade BNIP3 and NIX, forming a homeostatic regulatory loop. PPTC7 possesses an unusually weak mitochondrial targeting sequence to facilitate its outer-membrane retention and mitophagy control. Upon starvation, PPTC7 is transcriptionally upregulated in mouse liver to repress mitophagy, which critically maintains hepatic mitochondrial mass, bioenergetics and gluconeogenesis. Collectively, PPTC7 functions as a mitophagy sensor that integrates homeostatic and physiological signals to dynamically control BNIP3 and NIX degradation, thereby maintaining proper mitochondrial mass and cellular homeostasis.

Whilst kinases can be readily identified by highly conserved kinase domains, the downstream function of many protein kinases remains unknown, even more so for kinases of divergent eukaryotes, such as the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria. PfPK8 (PF3D7_0203100) is an orphan kinase in Plasmodium falciparum that bears some homology to STE kinases but has no known function. To reveal the function of PfPK8 we investigated PfPK8 knockout parasites with an untargeted multi-omics workflow. Phosphoproteomics analysis identified six putative phosphorylation targets in the parasite nucleus, including another kinase, a histone acetyltransferase, and three transcription-associated proteins, including the transcription factor AP2-12 (PF3D7_1239200). Untargeted metabolomics and proteomics analysis demonstrated no impact of the PfPK8 knockout on metabolism but revealed differential regulation of exported surface proteins from multi-gene families. Transcriptomics analysis confirmed differential expression of these multi-gene family proteins, particularly de-repression of var genes encoding PfEMP1 variants. DAP-seq analysis of genes bound to the AP2-12 transcription factor also identified significant enrichment of var genes, with significant overlap between the group B/C and C var genes enriched in both the PfPK8-KO transcriptomics and AP2-12 DAP-seq analysis. Overall, this study revealed that the primary function of PfPK8 is to regulate transcription of antigenic variant genes via phosphorylation of nuclear targets including the AP2-12 transcription factor.

However, the molecular mechanism whereby regulation of SGs programmatically disassembly and ATP restoration remain poorly understood in mammalian cells. Here we found that defect of OGA in cells leads to aggregates formation, severe autophagy and eventually apoptosis during stress recovery. OGA, which localized in SGs, had no effect on SGs formation but could protect SGs from rapid disassembly during stress recovery stage. Then the SGs localized glycolysis-related enzymes were reserved and concentrated in SGs during stress release for ATP production in a proximity manner, which was vital to guarantee cells resistant to stress and survival during recovery. Finally, supplementation of ATP to OGA knockdown cells during stress recovery significantly rescue cell from aggregates, autophagy and apoptosis. Together, these results describe a brand new mechanism on how OGA regulates the programmed disassembly of stress granules and restoration of ATP to safeguard cell viability in a very precisely programmed process, whose rate is rigorous regulated.

Identifying and understanding the biochemical changes that sensitize the ageing brain to neurodegeneration will provide new opportunities for dementia prevention and treatment. This study aimed to determine how ageing and major genetic risk factors for dementia affect the hippocampal proteome and lipidome of neurologically-normal humans over the age of 65. The hippocampus was chosen as it is highly susceptible to atrophy with ageing and in several neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: Mass spectrometry-based proteomic and lipidomic analysis of CA1 hippocampus samples from 74 neurologically normal human donors, aged 66 – 104, was used in combination with multiple regression models and gene set enrichment analysis to identify age-dependent changes in the proteome and lipidome. ANOVA was used to test the effect of major dementia risk alleles in the TMEM106B and APOE genes on the hippocampal proteome and lipidome, adjusting for age, gender, and post-mortem interval. Fibrillar C-terminal TMEM106B fragments were isolated using sarkosyl fractionation and quantified by immunoblotting. Results: Forty proteins were associated with age at false discovery rate-corrected P&lt;0.05, including proteins that regulate cell adhesion, the cytoskeleton, amino acid and lipid metabolism, and ribosomal subunits. TMEM106B, a regulator of lysosomal and oligodendrocyte function, was regulated with greatest effect size. The increase in TMEM106B levels with ageing was specific to carriers of the rs1990622-A allele in the TMEM106B gene that increases risk for frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and hippocampal sclerosis with ageing. Rs1990622-A was also associated with higher TMEM106B fibril content. Hippocampal lipids were not significantly affected by APOE genotype, however levels of myelin-enriched sulfatides and hexosylceramides were significantly lower, and polyunsaturated phospholipids were higher, in rs1990622-A carriers after controlling for APOE genotype. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that TMEM106B protein abundance is increased with brain ageing in humans, establishes that dementia risk allele rs1990622-A predisposes to TMEM106B fibril formation in the hippocampus, and provides the first evidence that rs1990622-A affects brain lipid homeostasis, particularly myelin lipids. Our data suggests that TMEM106B is one of a growing list of major dementia risk genes that affect glial lipid metabolism.

Here, we show that altering the bacterial composition of two widespread Symbiodiniaceae species, during their free-living stage, results in a significant shift in their cellular metabolism. Indeed, the abundance of monosaccharides and the key phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) were correlated with the presence of specific bacteria, including members of the Labrenzia (Roseibium) and Marinobacter genera. Single-cell stable isotope tracking revealed that these two bacterial genera are involved in reciprocal exchanges of carbon and nitrogen with Symbiodiniaceae. We identified the provision of IAA by Labrenzia and Marinobacter, and this metabolite caused a significant growth enhancement of Symbiodiniaceae. By unravelling these interkingdom interactions, our work demonstrates how specific bacterial associates fundamentally govern Symbiodiniaceae fitness.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001825	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8T714			Metabolic profiling of newborn DBS samples associated with transit and false elevation of glutarylcarnitine (C5DC)	Background: Glutaric aciduria type-1 (GA-1) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by a glutaryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (GCDH) deficiency, affecting approximately 1 in 110,000 individuals globally. This enzymatic deficiency leads to abnormal elevations of glutaryl-CoA and its derivatives, specifically glutaric acid (GA), 3-hydroxyglutaric acid (3OHGA), and glutarylcarnitine (C5DC). Clinical manifestations encompass macrocephaly, developmental delays, and movement disorders. Early detection via genetic testing and newborn screening (NBS), utilizing GA-1 biomarkers in dried blood spot (DBS) samples, is vital for prompt intervention. Despite the NBS system, transit-elevated C5DC-containing DBS samples from falsely suspected GA-1 newborns sometimes yield normal results, posing diagnostic sensitivity and specificity challenges. Consequently, there is a growing need for alternative diagnostic tools. Comprehensive mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics offers promise in identifying additional informative biomarkers for distinguishing falsely suspected GA-1 newborns from healthy counterparts. Methodology: In this prospective study, we obtained DBS samples with transit-elevated C5DC levels from falsely suspected GA-1 newborns (n=47) and matched control DBS samples from healthy newborns (n=47) through the NBS program. Metabolites were extracted and analyzed via liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Subsequent multivariate and univariate statistical analyses and feature annotation enabled biomarker and pathway investigations for significantly altered metabolites. Results: Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed alterations in 582 upregulated and 546 downregulated metabolites. The commonly used GA-1 biomarkers, including C5DC, exhibited no significant changes in the falsely suspected GA-1 DBS samples. Conversely, 155 endogenous metabolites displayed significant variations compared to the control group. Furthermore, our data identified novel altered metabolic biomarkers, such as N-Palmitoylcysteine, 3-hydroxylinoleoylcarnitine, Heptacarboxyporphyrin, and MG (0:0/20:1/0:0), along with perturbed metabolic pathways like sphingolipid and thiamine metabolism associated with the transient and falsely elevated C5DC levels in DBS samples. Conclusions: Our untargeted metabolomics investigation unveiled distinct metabolic pathways and biomarkers linked to the transient C5DC elevation in DBS samples from falsely suspected GA-1 newborns. These findings can enhance GA-1 diagnosis by serving as predictive indicators during NBS analysis. Validation studies are warranted to confirm the presence of these newly identified metabolic pathways and biomarkers in confirmed GA-1 cases.

Examination of TAMC metabolic phenotypes in mouse models and human GBM patients identified the de-novo creatine metabolic pathway as a hallmark of TAMCs. Multi-omics analyses revealed that TAMCs surround the hypoxic peri-necrotic regions of GBM and express the creatine metabolic enzyme glycine amidinotransferase (GATM). Conversely, GBM cells located within these same regions are uniquely specific in expressing the creatine transporter (SLC6A8). Therefore, we hypothesized that TAMCs provide creatine to tumors, promoting GBM progression. Isotopic tracing demonstrated that TAMC-secreted creatine can be taken up by tumor cells. Creatine supplementation protected tumors from hypoxia-induced stress which was abrogated with genetic ablation or pharmacologic inhibition of SLC6A8. Lastly, inhibition of creatine transport using the clinically relevant compound, RGX-202-01, blunted tumor growth, and enhanced radiation therapy in-vivo. This work highlights that myeloid-to-tumor transfer of creatine promotes tumor growth in the hypoxic niche.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001827	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8JQ6C			Deep Metabolic Phenotyping of Newborn Cord Blood Reveals Maternal-Fetal Interactions and Disease Risk	Metabolites are small molecules circulating in the mother, placental, and fetal blood that can have a profound effect on a developing fetus (1, 2). Many metabolites from pregnant mothers cross the placenta to provide energy, structural components, essential nutrients, and signals to the developing fetus (3, 4). Issues with proper transmission of metabolites to the fetus, whether through gestational diabetes, placental insufficiency, or other sources can permanently damage the fetus (5-7). However, quantification of many metabolites entering and exiting the fetus are unknown; associations between microbial metabolites in umbilical cords and disease have not been thoroughly investigated; and there remains a lack of quantifiable metabolic effects of some of the most common medications administered during pregnancy and parturition. Here we identified and quantified many metabolites with a gradient between arterial and venous cord blood; we demonstrated that exogenous metabolites in umbilical cords associate with many health outcomes; and we show that medications can profoundly alter the metabolic milieu of the fetus. We greatly expanded the number of metabolites that demonstrate a gradient between arterial and venous blood, indicating absorption by the fetus, including several essential fatty acids. The microbial metabolites 3-indolepropionic acid, hydroxyhippuric acid and others are associated with many newborn diseases. Lastly, we show that exogenous medications like bupivacaine and betamethasone can have a profound impact on newborn metabolic profile. This study is the most comprehensive study of umbilical cord metabolic and disease associations to date. It reveals important aspects of fetal biology, like the reliance on specific essential fatty acid and taurine. It suggests several interventions in pregnant mothers that may help newborn health, including new fatty acids. This study serves as a valuable reference for investigators wishing to better understand the impact of medications on the developing fetus and neonate.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001828	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8F14S			Role of PI3K in Atrial Myopathy: Insights from Transgenic Mouse Models and Identification of a Dysregulated PI3K Lipid Profile in Individuals with Atrial Fibrillation	In a serendipitous discovery, atrial enlargement, fibrosis and thrombi was identified in a subset of transgenic mice with reduced phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K, class IA) in cardiac myocytes. Understanding mechanisms underlying atrial myopathy has important implications for understanding and preventing atrial fibrillation (AF). Prior work had shown that PI3K is an essential regulator of exercise-induced ventricular enlargement and protection, but the role in the atria was unknown. Further, while targeting IGF1-PI3K-Akt signaling has been considered a potential therapeutic strategy for the failing heart, growing evidence suggests fine-tuning IGF1-PI3K signaling would be necessary. Here, we undertook comprehensive physiological and molecular analyses in cardiac-specific transgenic mice with increased or decreased PI3K to assess the dose response impact of directly regulating PI3K. Elevated PI3K was associated with a dose-dependent increase in heart size, and preserved/enhanced function. In contrast, reduced PI3K led to cardiac dysfunction, fibrosis, arrhythmia, and increased susceptibility to atrial enlargement and thrombi. This phenotype was associated with dysregulation of a lipid species (GM3) that regulates the IGF1-PI3K pathway, cardiac stress and contractility genes. Proteomic profiling identified distinct signatures across atria with varying degrees of atrial dysfunction, enlargement, and presence of atrial thrombi. To assess the potential relevance in humans we assessed circulating PI3K-related lipids in plasma from athletes with/without AF. Dysregulation of GM3 and PI3K-related lipids were identified in athletes with AF. Collectively, this work advances our understanding of mechanisms underpinning atrial pathophysiology, offers new insights for therapeutic approaches targeting atrial myopathy and AF, and has identified potential new lipid markers for identifying individuals at risk of AF.

Xanthohumol, a flavonoid from the hops plant or placebo was administered to 27 healthy adults daily for eight weeks. Fecal, plasma, and 24-hr urine collections were obtained from participants at baseline and 2-week intervals. The main objective was to examine clinical safety and subjective tolerability of xanthohumol compared to placebo. Additional aims were to monitor biomarkers of inflammation, gut permeability, bile acid metabolism, short-chain fatty acids, and metabolism of xanthohumol.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001831	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M81Q73			Integrated gut metabolome and microbiome fingerprinting reveals that dysbiosis precedes allergic inflammation in IgE-mediated pediatric cow’s milk allergy	Background: IgE-mediated cow’s milk allergy (IgE-CMA) is one of the first allergies to arise in early childhood and may result from exposure to various milk allergens, of which β-lactoglobulin (BLG) and casein are the most important. Understanding the underlying mechanisms behind IgE-CMA is imperative for the discovery of novel biomarkers and the design of innovative treatment and prevention strategies. Methods: We report a longitudinal in vivo murine model, in which 2 mice strains (BALB/c and C57Bl/6) were sensitized to BLG using either cholera toxin or an oil emulsion (n=6 per group). After sensitization, mice were challenged orally, their clinical signs monitored, antibody (IgE and IgG1) and cytokine levels (IL-4 and IFN-γ) measured, and fecal samples subjected to metabolomics. The results of the murine models were further supported by fecal microbiome-metabolome data from our population of IgE-CMA (n=24) and healthy (n=23) children (Trial: NCT04249973), on which polar metabolomics, lipidomics and 16S rRNA metasequencing were performed. In vitro gastrointestinal digestions and multi-omics corroborated the microbial origin of proposed metabolic changes. Results: During sensitization, we observed multiple microbially derived metabolic alterations, most importantly bile acid, energy and tryptophan metabolites, that preceded allergic inflammation. The latter was reflected in a disturbed sphingolipid metabolism. We confirmed microbial dysbiosis, and its causal effect on metabolic alterations in our patient cohort, which was accompanied by metabolic signatures of low-grade inflammation. Conclusion: Our results indicate that gut dysbiosis precedes allergic inflammation and nurtures a chronic low-grade inflammation in children on elimination diets, opening important new opportunities for future prevention and treatment strategies.

Our group has performed an extensive study using both in-vitro and in-vivo models. Particularly, we used transgenic mice in which the Cgref1 gene is deleted to enable loss-of-function studies. Cgref1-knockout (KO) mice are generally leaner and metabolically healthier compared to wild type mice. To gain evidence of certain parameters, metabolomics studies have been performed for this project.

Severe asthmatic patients prescribed either Mepolizumab or Omalizumab were followed during treatment, and serum samples were collected before treatment (T0), and both at 6 (T1) and 18 months (T2) after starting biological treatment.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001834	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8NH80			Serum metabolomics reveals metabolic profile and potential biomarkers of ankylosing spondylitis	Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease that significantly impairs physical function, quality of life, and work ability in young individuals. Nonetheless, the identification of early radiographic changes in AS is frequently delayed, and the diagnostic efficacy of biomarkers remains moderately effective, with unsatisfactory sensitivity and specificity. Hence, it is imperative to identify biomarkers that can facilitate early diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of AS. A total of 67 AS patients and 67 healthy controls were recruited to procure plasma samples for the purpose of screening potential biomarkers of AS via untargeted combined with targeted metabolomics approach utlizing UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS and UHPLC-QQQ-MS/MS. Multivariate pattern recognition and univariate statistical analysis were employed to compare and elucidate the differential metabolites. The results indicated a notable divergence between the two groups, and a total of 170 different metabolites associated with the primary 6 metabolic pathways exhibiting a correlation with AS. Among those, 26 metabolites exhibited high sensitivity and specificity with area under curve (AUC) value were greater than 0.8. Subsequent targeted quantitative analysis discovered 3 metabolites, namely 3-amino-2-piperidone, hypoxanthine and octadecylamine, exhibiting excellent distinguishing ability based on the results of ROC curve and Random Forest model, thus qualifying as potential biomarkers for AS. Summarily, our non-targeted and targeted metabolomics investigations provide new insights into the metabolic profile and potential biomarker candidates of AS. These findings may provide additional diagnostic options for AS and enhance the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of the condition.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001835	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8HT5Q			Investigate the impact of feeding time on the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) in the mouse liver and heart using targeted metabolomics	The overall goal of this project is to advance our understanding of post-translational mechanisms that mediate metabolic regulation of time-of-day-specific protein functions to orchestrate daily rhythms and maintain homeostasis in animals. Robust daily biological rhythms over the 24-hour (h) day-night cycles are key hallmarks of animal health span and are strongly regulated by circadian clocks. Circadian clocks are cell autonomous molecular timers present in the brain and in peripheral organs that enable animals to adapt to predictable daily changes in environment and regulate rhythmic processes such as sleep-wake cycles, feeding-fasting cycles, metabolism, hormonal signaling and neuronal excitability. Besides light, the dominant time cue for the brain clock, metabolic signals from clock-controlled feeding-fasting cycles represent the most potent time cue to entrain and synchronize peripheral clocks in key organs. Much effort has been dedicated to understanding the metabolic regulation of daily biological rhythms, but many important mechanisms are only just emerging. We recently established that metabolic signals from feeding-fasting cycles regulate daily biological rhythms in Drosophila through rhythmic O-linked-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation). Protein O-GlcNAcylation is a nutrient sensitive posttranslational modification (PTM) that is tightly linked to metabolic status, as UDP-GlcNAc, the substrate of O-GlcNAcylation, is produced from hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), which integrates the metabolites from glucose, amino acid, lipid and nucleotide metabolism. We now propose to investigate whether feeding activity can regulate daily O-GlcNAcylation rhythm in mouse liver and heart and whether the levels of HBP metabolites in mouse liver and heart are affected by different feeding time within a day/night cycle. Here, we restricted the feeding time of C57BL/6 male mice to ZT12-24 (RF12-24. ZT, zeitgeber time; ZT0 indicates light on, while ZT12 indicates light off) v.s. ZT0-12 (RF0-12) for 3 weeks and collected liver and heart tissues every 4 hours over a 24-hour period. The liver and heart samples were subjected to targeted metabolomic analysis for HBP metabolites.

Model systems were established in which the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was acclimated for three months at temperatures below (14°C), equal to (20°C), and above (28°C) the temperature of optimal growth, and then inoculated with the heterotrophic bacterium Ruegeria pomeroyi.

We aim to generate a comprehensive understanding of this infrequent phenotype by comparing rates of cellular infection, immunophenotype, genomics, single-cell transcriptomics, metabolomics, and levels of plasma biomarkers in 16 VNPs and 29 HIV+ Progressors. During chronic infection VNPs show lower frequency of HIV-1-infected cells in periphery, which is associated with reduced CCR5 expression and higher prevalence of CCR5Δ32 heterozygosity. The CD8+ T-cell compartment displays a less cytotoxic and less activated phenotype in VNPs. Moreover, despite similar viremia, we found lower bystander CD4+ T-cell death in the VNPs, together with weaker IFN responses, reduced plasma levels of zonulin (a biomarker of intestinal permeability), altered tryptophan catabolism, and preserved LPS responsiveness in vitro. Overall, a complex multifactorial mechanism, suggesting gut-associated lymphoid tissue preservation, underlies resistance to HIV pathogenesis in VNPs.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001841	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8RB1J			Transcriptional regulation of amino acid metabolism by KDM2B	Epigenetic and metabolic alterations in cancer cells are intertwined. The concentration of metabolites can influence the activity of chromatin modifiers, which in turn can act as metabolic sensors that translate changes in cellular metabolism to transcriptional reprogramming. In the present study, we investigated the role of histone demethylase KDM2B in the metabolic reprogramming of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), in which KDM2B is selectively expressed at high levels. Knockdown of KDM2B in TNBC cell lines reduced their proliferation rate and tumor growth in vivo. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiling demonstrated that the Serine-Glycine pathway and One Carbon metabolism (SGOC) and other amino acid biosynthetic and catabolic processes are downregulated by the knockdown of KDM2B. Additionally, we see reduction of metabolites produced via these pathways (purines, pyrimidines, formate, glutathione and NADPH). Importantly, the expression of the enzymes involved in the SGOC metabolic pathway (e.g. PHGDH, PSAT1, PSPH, SHMT2, MTHFD1L, MTHFD2 and DHFR) depends on c-MYC, NRF2, and ATF4 which our data show that they are under the positive regulatory control of KDM2B. The epistatic relationship between these factors, with the expression of the enzymes of the SGOC pathway and the effects of the KDM2B knockdown on chromatin occupancy and accessibility of the promoters of these factors is in progress and will be presented. Analysis of TCGA data showed positive and statistically significant correlations between KDM2B and the SGOC gene signature in TNBC patients. In addition, the metabolic pathway signature that distinguishes control and shKDM2B-transduced cells corresponds to the metabolic signature of a subset of TNBCs, which have been reported to carry poor prognosis. The present study highlights the role of the epigenetic factor KDM2B as an upstream regulator of the metabolic reprogramming of TNBC.

However, the present study identified a subset of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells which are the major constituents of organ stroma neither proliferative nor senescent in tissues of the elderly, which we termed “mid-old status” cells. Upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes (IL1B and SAA1) and downregulation of anti-inflammatory genes (SLIT2 and CXCL12) were detected in mid-old cells. In the stroma, SAA1 promotes development of the inflammatory microenvironment via upregulation of MMP9, which decreases the stability of epithelial cells present on the basement membrane, decreasing epithelial cell function. Remarkably, the microenvironmental change and the functional decline of mid-old cells could be reversed by a young cell-originated protein, SLIT2. Our data identify functional reversion of mid-old cells as a potential method to prevent or ameliorate aspects of aging-related tissue dysfunction.

One major NAPDH production route is the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (committed step: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PD). Alternatives exist and can compensate in some tumors. Here, using genetically-engineered lung cancer model, we show that ablation of G6PD significantly suppresses KrasG12D/+;Lkb1-/- (KL) but not KrasG12D/+;p53-/- (KP) lung tumorigenesis. In vivo isotope tracing and metabolomics revealed that G6PD ablation significantly impaired NADPH generation, redox balance and de novo lipogenesis in KL but not KP lung tumors. Mechanistically, in KL tumors, G6PD ablation caused p53 activation that suppressed tumor growth. As tumor progressed, G6PD-deficient KL tumors increased an alternative NADPH source, serine-driven one carbon metabolism, rendering associated tumor-derived cell lines sensitive to serine/glycine depletion. Thus, oncogenic driver mutations determine lung cancer dependence on G6PD, whose targeting is a potential therapeutic strategy for tumors harboring KRAS and LKB1 co-mutations.

The Molecular Phenotypes of Null Alleles in Cells (MorPhiC) seeks to address this element of the strategic vision. Through the comprehensive generation of null alleles for every human gene and then cataloging the resulting molecular and cellular phenotypes, the mechanisms that relate gene function to observed phenotypes can be determined. Furthermore, the resulting catalog of knockouts and phenotypes will be made available for broader use by the biomedical community. Although multiple approaches can be leveraged to measure molecular and cellular phenotypes resulting from gene knockouts, metabolomics and lipidomics (i.e., biochemical phenotyping) provides an avenue to understand the link between gene function and phenotypes at a molecular level.

Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is a key enzyme in the lipogenesis pathway that is upregulated in many cancers and has gained popularity as a druggable target of interest for cancer treatment. The first FAS inhibitor discovered, cerulenin, initially showed promise for chemotherapeutic purposes until it was observed that it had adverse side effects in mice. TVB-2640 (Denifanstat), is part of the newer generation of inhibitors. With multiple generations of FAS inhibitors being developed, it is vital to understand their distinct molecular downstream effects to elucidate potential interactions in the clinic. Here, we profile the lipidome of two different colorectal cancer (CRC) spheroids treated with a generation 1 inhibitor (cerulenin) or a generation 2 inhibitor (TVB-2640). We observe that the cerulenin causes drastic changes to the spheroid morphology as well as alterations to the lipid droplets found within CRC spheroids. TVB-2640 causes higher abundances of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) whereas cerulenin causes decreased abundance of PUFAs. The increase in PUFAs in TVB-2640 exposed spheroids indicates it is causing cells to die via a ferroptotic mechanism rather than a conventional apoptotic or necrotic mechanism in the clinic. \r\n\r\n

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001850	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8KM71			A protocol for metabolomics-based gut microbiome investigations	A significant hurdle that has limited progress in microbiome science has been identifying and studying the diversity of metabolites produced by the gut microbes. Gut microbial metabolism produces thousands of difficult-to-identify metabolites, which present a challenge to study their roles in host biology. Over the recent years, mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has become one of the core technologies for identifying small metabolites. However, metabolomics expertise, ranging from sample preparation, instrument use, to data analysis, is often lacking in academic labs. Most targeted metabolomics methods provide high levels of sensitivity and quantification, while they are limited to a panel of predefined molecules that may not be informative to microbiome-focused studies. Here we have developed a gut microbe-focused and wide-spectrum metabolomic protocol using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) and bioinformatic analysis. This protocol enables users to carry out experiments from sample collection to data analysis, only requiring access to a LC-MS instrument, which is often available at local core facilities. By applying this protocol to samples containing human gut microbial metabolites, spanning from culture supernatant to human biospecimens, our approach enables high confidence identification of &gt;800 metabolites that can serve as candidate mediators of microbe-host interactions. We expect this protocol will lower the barrier in tracking gut bacterial metabolism in vitro and in mammalian hosts, propelling hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies and accelerating our understanding of the gut microbiome at the chemical level.

The molecular mechanisms responsible for this analgesia have not been identified. Through untargeted metabolomics, we found enriched anti-nociceptive metabolic pathways in L. mexicana-infected mice. Purines were elevated in infected macrophages and at the lesion site during chronic infection. These purines have anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties by acting through adenosine receptors, inhibiting TRPV1 channels, and promoting IL-10 production. We also found arachidonic acid metabolism enriched in the ear lesions compared to the non-infected controls. Arachidonic acid is a metabolite of anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). These endocannabinoids act on cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 and TRPV1 channels to exert anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Our study provides evidence of metabolic pathways upregulated during L. mexicana infection that may mediate anti-nociceptive effects experienced by CL patients and identifies macrophages as a source of these metabolites.

Results: The study explored alterations induced by DOX, 5-FU, and their combination treatment. Each treatment group exhibited unique metabolic profiles in plasma and tumor analysis. Univariate and enrichment analyses identified alterations in metabolic pathways, including glycine and serine metabolism, spermidine and spermine biosynthesis, and purine and pyrimidine pathways. The combination of DOX and 5-FU significantly influenced plasma and tumor metabolites. The comprehensive metabolic profiling of both plasma and tumor samples shed light on the intricate changes within the tumor microenvironment and their systemic implications. Conclusion: The study findings offer insights into the metabolic vulnerabilities of TNBC in vivo induced by the studied chemotherapeutics. These findings highlight the involved metabolites and metabolic pathways in the response of MDA-MB-231 cells to DOX, 5-FU, and their combination which advance our understanding of TNBC treatment strategies, offering new possibilities for enhancing therapeutic outcomes.

Pooled fecal metabolite extract samples were fractionated using an offline semi-preparative liquid chromatography. The resulting fractions were analyzed by an orthogonal LC-MS/MS method, and the data were searched against commercial, public and local spectral libraries. Multidimensional chromatography yielded more than a 3-fold improvement in identified compounds compared to the typical single-dimensional LC-MS/MS approach, and successfully identified several rare and novel compounds including atypical conjugated bile acid species. Most features identified by the new approach could be matched to features that were detectable, but not identifiable, in the original single-dimensional data. An evaluation of this approach in the context of patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection receiving fecal microbiota transplants is also included. Overall, our approach represents a powerful strategy for deeper annotation of the metabolome that can be implemented with common commercially-available instrumentation, and should be applicable to any dataset requiring deeper annotation of the metabolome.

There's evidence suggests a connection between microglia activation and epilepsy as well as cognitive impairment in TSC patients. However, how the causal variants of TSC1/2 genes identified in TSC patients affect human microglia and how they contribute to the neurological manifestations. This project is focus on this problem using human microglia generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a TSC patient.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001856	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8T42G			Glycine homeostasis requires reverse SHMT flux	The folate-dependent enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) reversibly converts serine into glycine and a tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon unit. Such one-carbon unit production plays a critical role in development, the immune system, and cancer. Using rodent models, here we show that the whole-body SHMT flux acts to net consume rather than produce glycine. Pharmacological inhibition of whole-body SHMT1/2 and genetic knockout of liver SHMT2 elevated circulating glycine levels up to eight-fold. Stable isotope tracing revealed that the liver converts glycine to serine, which is then converted by serine dehydratase into pyruvate and burned in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In response to diets deficient in serine and glycine, de novo biosynthetic flux was unaltered but SHMT2- and serine dehydratase-mediated catabolic flux was lower. Thus, glucose-derived serine synthesis does not respond to systemic demand. Instead, circulating serine and glycine homeostasis is maintained through variable consumption, with liver SHMT2 a major glycine-consuming enzyme.

Here, we develop a platform for high-throughput single-cell metabolomics (hi-scMet) of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). By combining flow cytometric isolation and nanoparticle-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, we routinely detected &gt;100 features from single cells. We mapped the single-cell metabolomes of all hematopoietic cell populations, and HSC subpopulations with different division times, detecting 33 features whose levels exhibited trending changes during HSC proliferation. We found progressive activation of oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OxiPPP) from dormant to active HSCs. Genetic or pharmacological interference with OxiPPP increased reactive oxygen species level in HSCs, reducing HSC self-renewal upon oxidative stress. Together, our work uncovers the metabolic dynamics during HSC proliferation, reveals a role of OxiPPP for HSC activation, and illustrates the utility of hi-scMet in dissecting metabolic heterogeneity of immunophenotypically defined cell populations.

Here, we performed comprehensive serum metabolome analysis of a total of 83 patients from two cohorts to determine that the acceleration of amino acid catabolism within 5 days from disease onset correlated with future disease severity. Increased levels of de-aminated amino acid catabolites involved in the de novo nucleotide synthesis pathway were identified as early prognostic markers that correlated with the initial viral load. We further employed mice models of SARS-CoV2-MA10 and influenza infection to demonstrate that such de-amination of amino acids and de novo synthesis of nucleotides were associated with the abnormal proliferation of airway and vascular tissue cells in the lungs during the early stages of infection. Consequently, it can be concluded that lung parenchymal tissue remodeling in the early stages of respiratory viral infections induces systemic metabolic remodeling and that the associated key amino acid catabolites are valid predictors for excessive inflammatory response in later disease stages.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001860	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8942T			Activation induces shift in nutrient utilization that differentially impacts cell functions in human neutrophils	Neutrophils could utilize a variety of metabolic sources to support their vital functions as the first responders in innate immunity. Here, using in vivo and ex vivo isotopic tracing, we quantitatively examined the contributions of different nutrients under specific conditions, and found that human circulating neutrophils, in contrast to neutrophil cell line, rely on glycogen storage as a major metabolic source under resting state, but rapidly switch to primarily using extracellular glucose upon activation with various stimuli. This shift is driven by a substantial increase in glucose uptake, which is mechanistically mediated by the rapid phosphorylation and translocation of GLUT1, that dominates the simultaneous increase in gross glycogen cycling. Shift in nutrient utilization impacts neutrophil functions in a function-specific manner: Oxidative burst depends on glucose utilization; whereas NETosis and phagocytosis can be flexibly supported by either glucose or glycogen; and neutrophil migration and fungal control are enhanced by the shift from glycogen utilization to glucose utilization. This provides a quantitative and dynamic understanding of fundamental features in neutrophil metabolism, and elucidates how metabolic remodeling shapes neutrophil functions, which has broad health relevance.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001861	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85B0W			Metabolic profiling of NPM1-deficient reparative BMDMs	BMDMs (1×107) were either induced toward the reparative phenotype as described above or left unstimulated. These BMDMs were then used to perform a metabolomics assay at Shanghai Biotree Biotech Co. Ltd. (China). Briefly, for each sample, 500 μl precooled MeOH/H2O (3/1, v/v) was added in. The samples were then vortexed for 30 sec. After precooling in dry ice, the samples were frozen and thawed three times in liquid nitrogen. They were then vortexed for 30 sec and sonicated for 15 min in an ice-water bath. Next, as a subsequent step, the samples were incubated at -40 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C (RCF = 13800 g, R = 8.6 cm). Afterwards, an aliquot of 400 μl of clear supernatant was collected and dried by spinning. As a reconstitution solution, mix 200 ml of ultrapure water with the residue. The reconstituted samples were vortexed before passing through the filter of the centrifuge tube, after which they were transferred to inserts in injection vials for HPLC-MS/MS analysis. The HPIC separation was carried out using an Thermo Scientific Dionex ICS-6000 HPIC System (Thermo Scientific), equipped with Dionex IonPac AS11-HC (2× 250 mm) and AG11-HC (2 mm×50 mm) columns. An AB SCIEX 6500 QTRAP+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB Sciex), equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface, in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, was applied for assay development. AB SCIEX Analyst Work Station Software (1.6.3 AB SCIEX), MultiQuant 3.0.3. software and Chromeleon7 were employed for MRM data acquisition and processing. The finalized dataset, inclusive of compound name, sample name, and concentration, was imported into SIMCA 16.0.2 software (Sartorius Stedim Data Analytics AB, Umea, Sweden) for comprehensive multivariate analysis. The data were subjected to scaling and logarithmic transformation to mitigate the effects of noise and excessive variance of the variables. After that, we utilized the R packages tidyverse, dplyr, magrittr, ggplot2, and ggrepel for data analysis and the construction of a volcano plot. Additionally, the R packages circlize and reshape2 were employed in the creation of a chord diagram. For the generation of a heatmap, we made use of the R package pheatmap.

On the other hand, while glycolysis-deficient cancers are generally vulnerable to OXPHOS inhibition in preclinical models, the full extent of phenotypical and mechanistic consequences of inhibiting OXPHOS in cancers capable of glycolysis is not yet well understood. We aimed to clarify the response and underlying mechanisms of colorectal cancer (CRC) that commonly exhibit the glycolytic phenotype to OXPHOS inhibition and to identify potential approaches to render such cells more sensitive to OXPHOS inhibitors.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001863	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8WX4S			Identifying subgroups of childhood obesity by using multiplatform metabotyping	Obesity results from an interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors such as diet, physical activity, culture, and socioeconomic status. Personalized treatments for obesity would be optimal, thus necessitating the identification of individual characteristics to improve the effectiveness of therapies. For example, genetic impairment of the leptin-melanocortin pathway can result in rare cases of severe early-onset obesity. Metabolomics has the potential to distinguish between a healthy and obese status; however, differentiating subsets of individuals within the obesity spectrum remains challenging. Factor analysis can integrate patient features from diverse sources, allowing an accurate subclassification of individuals. This study presents a workflow to identify metabotypes, particularly when routine clinical studies fail in patient categorization. 110 children with obesity (BMI &gt; +2 SDS) genotyped for nine genes involved in the leptin-melanocortin pathway (CPE, MC3R, MC4R, MRAP2, NCOA1, PCSK1, POMC, SH2B1, and SIM1) and two glutamate receptor genes (GRM7 and GRIK1) were studied; 55 harboring heterozygous rare sequence variants and 55 with no variants. Anthropometric and routine clinical laboratory data were collected, and serum samples processed for untargeted metabolomic analysis using GC-q-MS and CE-TOF-MS and reversed-phase U(H)PLC-QTOF-MS/MS in positive and negative ionization modes. Following signal processing and multialignment, multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were applied to evaluate the genetic trait association with metabolomics data and clinical and routine laboratory features. Neither the presence of a heterozygous rare sequence variant nor clinical/routine laboratory features determined subgroups in the metabolomics data. To identify metabolomic subtypes, we applied Factor Analysis, by constructing a composite matrix from the five analytical platforms. Six factors were discovered and three different metabotypes. Subtle but neat differences in the circulating lipids, as well as in insulin sensitivity could be established, which opens the possibility to personalize the treatment according to the patients categorization into such obesity subtypes. Metabotyping in clinical contexts poses challenges due to the influence of various uncontrolled variables on metabolic phenotypes. However, this strategy reveals the potential to identify subsets of patients with similar clinical diagnoses but different metabolic conditions. This approach underscores the broader applicability of Factor Analysis in metabotyping across diverse clinical scenarios.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001864	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8S425			Integrating uterine microbiome and metabolome to advance the understanding of the uterine environment in dairy cows with metritis	Background: Metritis is a prevalent uterine disease that affects the welfare, fertility, and survival of dairy cows. The uterine microbiome from cows that develop metritis and those that remain healthy do not differ from calving until 2 days after calving, after which there is a dysbiosis of the uterine microbiome characterized by a shift towards opportunistic pathogens such as Fusobacteriota and Bacteroidota. Whether these opportunistic pathogens proliferate and overtake the uterine commensals could be determined by the type of substrates present in the uterus. The objective of this study was to integrate uterine metabolome and microbiome data to advance the understanding of metritis development in dairy cows. Holstein cows (n = 104) had uterine fluid collected at calving and at the day of metritis diagnosis. Cows with metritis (n = 52) were paired with cows without metritis (n = 52) based on days after calving. First, the uterine metabolome and microbiome were evaluated individually, and then integrated using network analyses. Results: The uterine metabolome differed both at calving and on the day of metritis diagnosis between cows with and without metritis. The uterine microbiome did not differ at calving but differed on the day of metritis diagnosis between cows with and without metritis. Omics integration was performed between 153 significant metabolites and 6 significant bacteria genera on the day of metritis diagnosis. A total of 49 metabolites were correlated with 3 bacteria genera (i.e. Fusobacteria, Porphyromonas and Bacteroides) on the day of metritis diagnosis. The main metabolites have been associated with attenuation of biofilm formation by commensal bacteria, pathogenic bacterial overgrowth, defense mechanisms against the immune system, tissue damage and inflammation, and immune dysregulation. Conclusions: The data integration presented herein helps advance the understanding of metritis development in dairy cows. The identified metabolites may be promising targets for future interventions aiming to reduce pathogenic bacterial growth in the uterus, and therefore, reducing the incidence of metritis.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001865	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8NF08			Metabolomic study of the Quercus ilex response to Phytophthora cinnamomi, the main causal agent of the decline syndrome, and the identification of putative markers of resistance	Holm oak (Quercus ilex) is considered one of the major structural elements of the Mediterranean forests and the agrosilvopastoral Spanish “dehesa”, representing an outstanding example of ecological and socio-economic sustainability of forest ecosystems. The exotic pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi is one of the most aggressive of woody species, and together drought is considered one of the main drivers of holm oak decline. The effect and responses of P. cinnamomi inoculation has been studied on the offspring of mother trees growing in declined and non-declined areas of two Andalusian populations (Cordoba and Huelva). Damage symptoms, mortality, and chlorophyll fluorescence have been evaluated in seedlings inoculated under humid and drought conditions. The effect and responses depended on the population, being more accused in Huelva than in Cordoba population. An integrative proteomic and metabolomic analysis revealed the involvement of different metabolic pathways in response to the pathogen in both populations, such as amino acid metabolism pathways in Huelva, and terpenoids and flavonoids biosynthesis in Cordoba. However, a differential response was not observed between seedlings inoculated under humid and drought conditions. A protective mechanism of the photosynthetic apparatus is launched in response to defective photosynthetic activity in inoculated plants, which seems to be more efficient in the Cordoba population. In addition, enzymes and metabolites of the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways may confer higher resistance to Cordoba population. Some of these enzymes are proposed as markers of resilience, among which glyoxalase I, glutathione reductase, thioredoxin reductase, and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase are candidates.

In this study, we performed nontargeted lipidomic profiling study of 230 tissue samples from 79 NSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma (AC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) using UPLC-HRMS. oPLS-DA classification models enabled discrimination of tumor from adjacent noncancerous tissue (ANT) and distant noncancerous tissue (DNT) samples in NSCLC and AC with good accuracies (94.1 and 92.0%), sensitivities (93.8 and 91.1%), and specificities (94.2 and 92.5%) using 7 and 8 discriminant compounds, respectively. The discriminant feature panels were verified by external validation sets, revealing characteristic lipid signatures associated with NSCLC and showing prospects for entering the next evaluation stage of biomarker discovery for NSCLC detection and subtyping.

Increasing evidence shows that gut microbiota is potentially associated with sarcopenia. To investigate its role in sarcopenia, we (i) compared gut microbiota and metabolite composition between older persons with and without sarcopenia, (ii) performed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from human donors to antibiotic-treated mice, and (iii) identified two specific probiotics for treatment of sarcopenia in aged mice. Metagenomic and metabolomic analyses showed that people with sarcopenia had different microbial composition and metabolites, and that fecal purine could accurately identify sarcopenia. After FMT, mice receiving microbes from people with sarcopenia displayed lower muscle mass and strength. Correlation analysis revealed Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (LR) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (FP) were positively related to muscle health in old people. Both probiotic LR, FP and their combination enhanced muscle mass, function, and fiber type proportion of aged mice. Transcriptomics showed that genes related to tricarboxylic acid cycle were enriched after treatment. Mitochondria density, muscle ATP content, NAD+/NADH, proteins related to mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis were improved by both probiotics. In in-vitro studies, probiotic-conditional medium (PCM) containing FP supernatant or the combination of FP and LR supernatants enhanced proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts, whilst LR PCM alone did not. The mechanisms of LR may be related to colon health improvement. Results showed gut microbiota dysbiosis is one of pathogenic factors of sarcopenia, and muscle-related probiotics could alleviate age-related muscle disorders. Further clinical translation is warranted.

However, whether and how metabolic reprogramming in tumors generates chromatin vulnerabilities remain unclear. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors frequently harbor aberrant activation of the NRF2 antioxidant pathway which drives aggressive and chemo-resistant disease. Using a chromatin-focused CRISPR screen we report that NRF2 activation sensitizes LUAD cells to genetic and chemical inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDAC). This association is observed across cultured cells, mouse models and patient-derived xenografts. Integrative epigenomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis demonstrates that HDAC inhibition causes widespread redistribution of H4ac and its reader protein, which transcriptionally downregulates metabolic enzymes. This results in reduced flux into amino acid metabolism and de novo nucleotide synthesis pathways that are preferentially required for the survival of NRF2-active cancer cells. Together, our findings suggest NRF2 activation as a potential biomarker for effective repurposing of HDAC inhibitors to treat solid tumors.

For biodosimetry, metabolic profiling with mass spectrometry (MS) platforms has identified several small molecules in easily accessible biofluids that are promising for dose reconstruction. As our microbiome has profound effects on biofluid metabolite composition, it is of interest how variation in the host microbiome may affect metabolomics based biodosimetry. Here, we chemically ‘knocked out’ the microbiome of male and female C57BL/6 mice (Abx mice) and then irradiated (0, 3, or 8 Gy) them to determine the role of the host microbiome on biofluid radiation signatures (3 d serum).

The certain feature and contribution of gut microflora and metabolites to neuroendocrine changes in the menopausal transition remain largely unknown. Fecal samples of rats experiencing different reproductive stages were collected and processed for 16S rRNA and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry sequencing. The differences of gut microbiota and metabolites between young and middle-aged rats during proestrus and diestrus were analyzed and their relationships to neuroendocrine aging were then examined. This study documents specific gut microbial composition changes and concomitant shifting trends of metabolites during menopausal transition, which may initiate the gut-brain dysfunction in neuroendocrine aging.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001873	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8MF0Z			Uncoupling Metabolic Health from Thermogenesis via BCAA Flux in Brown Fat	Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is best known for thermogenesis. Whereas numerous studies in rodents found tight associations between the metabolic benefits of BAT and enhanced whole-body energy expenditure, emerging evidence in humans suggests that BAT is protective against Type 2 diabetes independent of body-weight. The underlying mechanism for this dissociation remained unclear. Here, we report that impaired mitochondrial flux of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) in BAT, by deleting mitochondrial BCAA carrier (MBC, encoded by Slc25a44), was sufficient to cause systemic insulin resistance without affecting whole-body energy expenditure or body-weight. We found that brown adipocytes catabolized BCAAs in the mitochondria as essential nitrogen donors for the biosynthesis of glutamate, N-acetylated amino acids, and one of the products, glutathione. BAT-selective impairment in mitochondrial BCAA flux led to elevated oxidative stress and insulin resistance in the liver, accompanied by reduced levels of BCAA-derived metabolites in the circulation. In turn, supplementation of glutathione restored insulin sensitivity of BAT-specific MBC knockout mice. Notably, a high-fat diet rapidly impaired BCAA catabolism and the synthesis of BCAA-nitrogen derived metabolites in the BAT, while cold-induced BAT activity is coupled with an active synthesis of these metabolites. Together, the present work uncovers a mechanism through which brown fat controls metabolic health independent of thermogenesis via BCAA-derived nitrogen carriers acting on the liver.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001875	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8BX4T			A High-Fat Eucaloric Diet Induces Reprometabolic Syndrome of Obesity in Normal Weight Women	Objective: We examined the effects of one month of a eucaloric, high-fat (48% of calories) diet (HFD) on gonadotropin secretion in normal weight women to interrogate the role of free fatty acids and insulin in mediating the relative hypogonadotropic hypogonadism of obesity. Methods: Eighteen eumenorrheic women (BMI 18-25 kg/m2) were studied in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle before and after exposure to a HFD with frequent blood sampling for LH and FSH, followed by an assessment of pituitary sensitivity to GnRH. Mass spectrometrybased plasma metabolomic analysis was also performed. Paired testing and time series analysis were performed as appropriate. Results: Mean endogenous LH (unstimulated) was significantly decreased after the HFD (4.3 ±1.0 vs 3.8 ± 1.0, P&lt;0.01); mean unstimulated FSH was not changed. Both LH (10.1 ± 1.0 vs 7.2 ± 1.0, P&lt;0.01), and FSH (9.5 ± 1.0 vs 8.8 ± 1.0, P&lt;0.01) response to 75 ng/kg of GnRH were reduced after the HFD. Mean LH pulse amplitude and LH interpulse interval were unaffected by the dietary exposure. Eucaloric HFD exposure did not cause weight change. Plasma metabolomics confirmed adherence with elevation of fasting free fatty acids (especially long-chain mono-, poly- and highly-unsaturated fatty acids) by the last day of the HFD. Conclusion: One-month exposure to a HFD successfully induced key reproductive and metabolic features of Reprometabolic Syndrome in normal weight women. Dietary factors may underly the gonadotrope compromise seen in obesity related subfertility and that therapeutic dietary interventions, independent of weight loss, may be possible.

However, it remains unclear whether detectable characteristic metabolome exists in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues and biofluids for early diagnosis. We conducted NMR- and MS-based metabolomics on 1,153 matched ESCC tissues, normal mucosae, pre- and one-week post-operative sera and urines from 560 participants across three hospitals, with machine learning, logistic regression and WGCNA. Aberrations in 'alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism' proved to be prevalent throughout the ESCC evolution, and were reflected in 16 serum and 10 urine metabolic signatures that were consistently identified by NMR and MS in both discovery and validation sets. NMR-based simplified panels of any five serum or urine metabolites outperformed clinical serological tumor markers (AUC = 0.984 and 0.930, respectively), and were effective in distinguishing early-stage ESCC in test set (serum accuracy = 0.994, urine accuracy = 0.879). Collectively, NMR-based biofluid screening can reveal characteristic metabolic events of ESCC and be feasible for early detection (ChiCTR2300073613).

Traditionally, these fruits are harvested and stored for at least 2 weeks before consumption. During this period, the fruit reaches its well-known and peculiar organoleptic and texture characteristics. However, the spread of more profitable fruit tree species, resulted in its progressive erosion. In this work we performed proteomic and metabolomic fruit analyses at three times after harvesting to provide data on its chemical composition and nutritional and nutraceutical properties.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001878	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8ZQ63			Lipidomics and plasma hormone reveal indicators of reproductive status in Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris)	Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) are protected as a threatened species, and data are lacking regarding their reproductive physiology. This study aimed to (1) quantify plasma steroid hormones in Florida manatees from two field sites, Crystal River and Indian River Lagoon, at different gestational stages and to (2) determine the relationship between plasma progesterone concentrations and lipid biochemistry in relation to pregnancy status. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric analysis was used to measure plasma steroid hormones and lipids. Pregnant female manatees were morphometrically distinct from male and non-pregnant female manatees, characterized by larger body weight and maximal girth. Progesterone concentrations in manatees were also elevated during early gestation versus late gestation. Cholesterol, an important metabolic lipid and precursor for reproductive steroids, was not different between groups. Lipidomics quantified 949 lipids and plasma concentrations of a sphingolipid, ceramide non-hydroxy fatty acid-sphingosine and several glycerophospholipids, including lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamines, plasmenyl-phosphatidylserines and monomethyl phosphatidylethanolamines, were associated with pregnancy status in the Florida manatee. This research contributes to improving knowledge of manatee reproductive physiology by providing data on plasma steroid hormones relative to reproductive status and by assessing how plasma lipids in healthy Florida manatees correspond to progesterone levels. This lipid panel has potential as a diagnostic approach to identify pregnant individuals in fresh and archived samples.

We investigated the dynamic metabolomic footprint of a multidrug-resistant hypermutable Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate exposed to ceftolozane/tazobactam as continuous infusion (4.5g/day, 9g/day) in a hollow-fiber infection model over 7-9 days in biological replicates (n=5). Bacterial samples were collected at 0, 7, 23, 47, 71, 95, 143, 167, 191 and 215h, the supernatant quenched and extracellular metabolites extracted. Metabolites were analyzed via untargeted metabolomics, including hierarchical clustering and correlation with quantified total and resistant bacterial populations. The time-courses of five metabolites were mathematically modeled. These five (of 1921 detected) metabolites were from enriched pathways (arginine and central carbon metabolism). Absorbed L-arginine and secreted L-ornithine were highly correlated with the total bacterial population (r -0.79 and 0.82 respectively, p&lt;0.0001). Ribose-5-phosphate, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate and trehalose-6-phosphate correlated with the resistant subpopulation (0.64, 0.64 and 0.67, respectively, p&lt;0.0001), and were likely secreted due to resistant growth overcoming oxidative and osmotic stress induced by ceftolozane/tazobactam. Using PK/PD-based transduction models, these metabolites were successfully modeled based on the total or resistant bacterial populations. The models well described the abundance of each metabolite across the differing time-course profiles of biological replicates, based on bacterial killing and, importantly, resistant regrowth. These proof-of-concept studies suggest further exploration is warranted to determine the generalizability of these findings. The metabolites modeled in this work are not exclusive to bacterial cells. Future studies may use this approach to identify bacteria-specific metabolites correlating with resistance, which would ultimately be extremely useful for clinical translation.

Apart from the heightened susceptibility to chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity significantly escalates healthcare costs. Effective public health strategies are essential for addressing issues related to early detection, diagnosis, and personalized treatment plans. This emphasizes the crucial need for a deep understanding of biochemical pathways, patient monitoring, and prognosis. In this context, metabolomics has become a valuable approach, focusing on the identification of metabolites in biofluids and tissues.In this study, an untargeted metabolomics-based method was employed to investigate metabolomic changes and their relationship to pathways in overweight and obese individuals. Plasma samples were collected from 29 healthy individuals with normal weight, 17 overweight individuals, and 28 obese individuals who met the inclusion criteria for the study. The plasma samples were analyzed using highly sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Pantothenic acid and L-proline showed increased levels in the overweight group, whereas phenylacetaldehyde and glycerophosphocholine were notably decreased compared to the normal weight group. Conversely, the obese group exhibited elevated levels of specific metabolites, including L-leucine, L-tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine. On the contrary, the obese group demonstrated decreased levels of other metabolites such as 2,3-Diaminopropionic acid, and phenylacetaldehyde. Additionally, significant changes in metabolic pathways, such as pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, and beta-alanine metabolism, were observed in the overweight group. In contrast, the obese group displayed significant alterations in phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and beta oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids. The present investigation sheds light on the potential diagnostic significance of certain metabolites in obesity and the impact of their level changes on specific metabolic pathways. Additional studies are necessary to confirm the association of these metabolites in obesity and to confirm their diagnostic value.

The gut microbiota has also been shown to be linked to psychological factors. Here, we found a marked deteriorative effect of chronic stress in multiple CRC models, including chemically-induced (AOM/DSS), genetically engineered (APCmin/+), and xenograft tumor mouse models. RNA-seq data from colon tissues revealed that expression of stemness-related genes was upregulated in the stressed CRC group by activated β-catenin signaling, which was further confirmed by results from ex vivo organoid analyses as well as in vitro and in vivo cell tumorigenicity assays. 16S rRNA sequencing of the gut microbiota showed that chronic stress disrupted gut microbes, and antibiotic treatment and fecal microbiota transplantation abolished the stimulatory effects of chronic stress on CRC progression. Stressed CRC mice displayed a significant decrease in Lactobacillus johnsonii (L. johnsonii) abundance, which was inversely correlated with tumor load. Moreover, protocatechuic acid (PCA) was identified as a beneficial metabolite produced by L. johnsonii based on metabolome sequencing and LC‒MS/MS analysis. Replenishment of L. johnsonii or PCA blocked chronic stress-induced CRC progression by decreasing β-catenin expression. Furthermore, PCA activated the cGMP pathway, and the cGMP agonist sildenafil abolished the effects of chronic stress on CRC. Altogether, these data identify that stress impacts the gut microbiome to support CRC progression.

While previous research has elucidated the role of Estrogen (E2) in metabolism remodeling and ATP production, its effects on purine metabolism remained unexplored. This study investigates the impact of E2 signalling on purine metabolism in CRC cells. We demonstrate, for the first time, a protective effect of E2 on CRC cells by targeting the purine synthesis pathway through its receptor estrogen receptor α (ERα). A full metabolomic profiling, next generation sequencing (NGS) and integrated OMICS were conducted for HCT-116 cells treated with E2 with and without silencing ERα. Our results revealed an enrichment of the purine metabolic pathway, with 27 genes in the de novo purine synthesis pathway downregulated in E2-treated CRC cells. Besides, E2-induced DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis are ERα-dependent. Our findings suggest potential therapeutic avenues for CRC treatment through antimetabolites targeting purine synthesis, as E2 treatment reduces the expression of relevant metabolites.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001883	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M89X4H			A small molecule macrophage migration inhibitory factor agonist ameliorates age-related myocardial intolerance to ischemia-reperfusion insults via metabolic regulation	Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an innate cytokine that regulates both inflammatory and homeostatic responses. MIF is expressed by cardiomyocytes, where it exerts a protective action against ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This effect is attenuated in the senescent heart due to an intrinsic, age-related reduction in MIF expression. We hypothesized that treating the aged heart with the small molecule MIF agonist (MIF20) can reinforce protective MIF signaling in cardiomyocytes, leading to a beneficial effect against I/R stress. The administration of MIF20 at the onset of reperfusion was found to not only decrease myocardial infarct size but also preserves systolic function in the aged heart. Protection from I/R injury was reduced in mice with cardiomyocyte-specific Mif deletion, consistent with the mechanism of action of MIF20 to allosterically increase MIF affinity for its cognate receptor CD74. We further found MIF20 to contribute to the maintenance of mitochondrial fitness and to preserve the contractile properties of aged cardiomyocytes under hypoxia/reoxygenation. MIF20 augments protective metabolic responses by reducing the NADH/NAD ratio, leading to a decrease in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the aged myocardium under I/R stress. We also identify alterations in the expression levels of the downstream effectors PDK4 and LCAD, which participate in the remodeling of the cardiac metabolic profile. Data from this study demonstrates that pharmacologic augmentation of MIF signaling provides beneficial homeostatic actions on senescent myocardium under I/R stress.

Although the circadian system appears to regulate nutrient absorption, little is known about the effects of eTRE on intestinal absorption. In this randomized crossover trial, 16 healthy adults follow a controlled, weight-maintenance diet for 9 days consuming all calories between 0800 and 1400 (eTRE schedule) or 0800 and 2000 (control schedule). We measure the energy content of the diet, stool, and urine with bomb calorimetry and calculate intestinal energy absorption. The eTRE schedule is more effective than the control eating schedule for improving markers of cardiometabolic health, including 24-h mean glucose concentrations and glycemic variability, assessed as the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions. However, eTRE has no effect on intestinal energy and macronutrient absorption, gastrointestinal transit time, colonic hydrogen gas production, or stool microbial composition, suggesting eTRE does not impact gastrointestinal function.

The sample handling conditions included a combination of three variables, use of preservative (None, Borate, or Chlorhexidine), refrigeration storage time (0h or 24h), or freeze-thaws (either 1x or 3x freeze-thaws, thawed on ice, in a refrigerator, or at room temperature). Samples were taken from 13 participants, and then aliquoted and subjected to the various conditions. Comparisons between treatment effects were taken between pairs of samples within each participant’s sample set, a within participant paired design.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001888	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8P728			Central Transcriptional Regulator Controls Growth and Carbon Storage under High Light Stress in Photosynthetic Microalgae Model Strains	Carbon capture efficiency and biochemical storage are some of the primary drivers of photosynthetic productivity and by extension crop yield. To elucidate the mechanisms governing yield phenotypes and carbon allocation regulatory elements, we selected two microalgae strains as simplified models of photosynthetic crops. The Picochlorum celeri TG2 isolate is one of the fastest growing algae and in this work is juxtaposed to a closely related, slower growing, isolate, TG1, of the same species with less than 2% genomic divergence. Through the application of a comprehensive systems biology light-stress response study, we observed a stark difference in carbon assimilation and storage rates, with the slower growing isolate accumulating almost three times the amount of starch compared to the fast-growing isolate. We characterized the carbon storage rates and allocation dynamics, with metabolic bottlenecks, and transport rates of intermediates underlying the variations in growth and composition in high light using instationary 13C-fluxomics experiments. High light stress analysis of transcriptomic dynamics during acclimation of the strains from low to high light identified a widespread response with up to 73% the annotated gene set significantly differentially expressed after only 1 hour. Broad transcriptional regulatory control was inferred by a rapid depletion of a global diel-responsive transcription factor closely related to a circadian-regulator in plants, as the single most distinct transcription factor. Transferring this factor to the slower variant increased yield, specific growth rate, and carbohydrate accumulation of the selected engineered strain, providing further evidence for a coordinating regulatory mechanism for this complex phenotype.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001890	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8DQ64			Untargeted lipidomics of WT and Cyp2c44(-/-) mice liver.	Cytochrome P450 epoxygenase Cyp2c44 and their metabolite epoxyeicosatrienoic acids or EETs promotes insulin sensitivity. Mice lacking Cyp2c44 exhibits hepatic insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is also intricately related to increased hepatic lipid accumulation and hyperlipidemia. Interestingly, Cyp2c44(-/-) mice in standard chow diet had significantly increased hepatic and plasma lipid levels compared to wild-type mice. To identify the nature of these lipids, with a focus on fatty acids, we performed lipidomic analysis of liver homogenates from SD-fed WT and Cyp2c44(-/-) mice. We identified 2425 lipids (1152 in negative mode and 1273 in positive mode) that passed both quality control filters set as 25% for QC RSD and 10% for QC/blank ratio. Principal component analysis revealed two distinct lipid clusters in livers of WT and Cyp2c44(-/-) mice. Heatmap analysis revealed a hierarchical clustering of significant differences occurring in lipid species between WT and Cyp2c44(-/-) livers. Volcano plot analysis of the 1152 lipids identified in the negative mode (which contain fatty acids) revealed 160 lipid species upregulated, 61 downregulated, and 931 not significantly changed in Cyp2c44(-/-) livers compared to WT livers. Analysis of fatty acids classes in negative mode identified a total of 146 fatty acids, with 49 upregulated, 3 downregulated and 94 unchanged in Cyp2c44(-/-) compared to WT livers. Among the fatty acids that are significantly upregulated in the livers of Cyp2c44(-/-), we detected the saturated fatty acids palmitic acid; the monosaturated oleic acid; and the polyunsaturated arachidonic, linoleic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids. Importantly, arachidonic acid is the major substrate of Cyp2c epoxygenases, although linoleic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids are also efficient alternative substrates. We thus hypothesized that Cyp2c44 also governs hepatic lipid metabolism.

COVID-19 is a contagious globally threatening infectious disease that accounted for an ongoing pandemic that manifested in multi-organs diseases and failures. The current study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the Pfizer and Sinopharm vaccines in relation to metabolomic alterations and their association with immune pathways. The study employed a cross-sectional design and utilized an untargeted metabolomics-based approach. Plasma samples were collected from three groups: non- vaccinated participants, Sinopharm vaccinated participants, and Pfizer vaccinated participants. Comparative metabolomic analysis was performed using TIMS-QTOF, and a one-way ANOVA test was conducted using MetaboAnalyst Software. Out of the 105 detected metabolites, 72 showed statistically significant alterations (p&lt;0.05) among the different groups. Several metabolites, including neopterin, pyridoxal, and syringic acid, were highly altered in individuals vaccinated with Pfizer. On the other hand, sphinganine, neopterin, and sphingosine were impacted in individuals vaccinated with Sinopharm. These metabolites could potentially serve as biomarkers for vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, both Pfizer and Sinopharm vaccinations were found to affect sphingolipid metabolism pathways and histidine metabolism pathways when compared to the control group. The Sinopharm group exhibited altered lysine degradation compared to the control group. When comparing the enriched pathways of the Pfizer and Sinopharm groups, purine metabolism was found to be affected. Additionally, perturbations in tryptophan metabolism and vitamin B6 metabolism were observed when comparing the Pfizer group with both the control and Sinopharm groups. These findings highlight the importance of metabolomics in assessing vaccine effectiveness and identifying potential biomarkers.

ERRγ is a member of orphan nuclear receptors which plays a regulatory role in mitochondrial biosynthesis, energy metabolism, oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, inflammation, and especially metabolic pathways. Here we investigate the role of pharmacological agonist of ERRγ, DY131, in AKI mice induced by cisplatin, IR and LPS. DY131 ameliorated renal function, tubular injury, cell apoptosis and inflammation in AKI mice with multiple causes. Furthermore, we performed LC-MS/MS analyses using renal tissues from cisplatin-induced AKI mice with or without DY131 treatment. Strikingly, the data revealed that DY131 alleviated cisplatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and energy metabolism disorder, as well as multiple metabolic disorders. Taken together, the findings highlighted the protective effect of DY131 on AKI probably via improving mitochondrial function and energy metabolism.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001894	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8WQ6G			Retinoid levels measurement in kidney and serum	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function and affects ca. 13.4% of the global population. Progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis, driven in part by proximal tubule (PT) damage, is a hallmark of late stages of CKD and contributes to the development of kidney failure, for which there are limited treatment options. Normal kidney development requires signaling by vitamin A (retinol), which is metabolized to retinoic acid (RA), an endogenous agonist for the retinoic acid receptors (RAR alpha, beta, gamma). RARalpha levels are decreased in a mouse model of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and restored with RA administration; additionally, RA treatment reduces fibrosis. We developed a mouse model in which a spatiotemporal (tamoxifen-inducible) deletion of RARalpha in kidney PT cells of adult mice causes mitochondrial dysfunction, massive PT injury, and apoptosis without the use of additional nephrotoxic substances. Long-term effects (3-4.5 months) of RARalpha deletion include increased PT secretion of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta1), inflammation, interstitial fibrosis, and decreased kidney function, all of which are major features of human CKD. Therefore, RARalpha’s actions in proximal tubules (PTs) are crucial for PT homeostasis, and loss of RARalpha causes injury and a key CKD phenotype.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001895	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8S14W			Proteomic and metabolomic signatures of rectal tumor discriminate patients with different responses to preoperative radiotherapy	Background: Neoadjuvant radiotherapy (neo-RT) is widely used in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) as a component of radical treatment. Despite the advantages of neo-RT, which typically improves outcomes in LARC patients, the lack of reliable biomarkers that predict response and monitor the efficacy of therapy, can result in the application of unnecessary aggressive therapy affecting patients’ quality of life. Hence, the search for molecular biomarkers for assessing the radio responsiveness of this cancer represents a relevant issue. Methods: Here, we combined proteomic and metabolomic approaches to identify molecular signatures, which could discriminate LARC tumors with good and poor responses to neo-RT. Results: The integration of data on differentially accumulated proteins and metabolites made it possible to identify disrupted metabolic pathways and signaling processes connected with response to irradiation, including ketone bodies synthesis and degradation, purine metabolism, energy metabolism, degradation of fatty acid, amino acid metabolism, and focal adhesion. Moreover, we proposed multi-component panels of proteins and metabolites which could serve as a solid base to develop biomarkers for monitoring and predicting the efficacy of preoperative RT in rectal cancer patients. Conclusions: We proved that an integrated multi-omic approach presents a valid look at the analysis of the global response to cancer treatment from the perspective of metabolomic reprogramming.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001897	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8HH8R			Defective mitochondria remodelling in B cells leads to an aged immune response	The germinal centre (GC) reaction requires a unique bioenergetic supply. Although mitochondria are remodelled upon antigen stimulation, mitochondrial function in B cells is still poorly understood. To gain a better understanding of the role of mitochondria in B cell function, we generated mice that lack, specifically in B cells, Tfam, a transcription factor necessary for mitochondrial biogenesis. Tfam knock-out (KO) mice displayed a blockage of the GC reaction and established an immune response featured by the differentiation of activated B cells towards memory B cells and aged-related B cells, hallmarks of an aged immune response. Unexpectedly, GC blockage in Tfam KO mice did not cause defects in the bioenergetic supply, but this phenotype was associated with a defect in the remodelling of the lysosomal compartment in B cells. Therefore, these results may describe a new mitochondrial function for antigen presentation during the GC reaction, the abrogation of which may be the basis of an aged immune response.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001898	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8CQ76			Identification and validation of serum metabolite biomarkers for endometrial cancer diagnosis	Endometrial cancer (EC) stands as the most prevalent gynecological tumor in women worldwide. Notably, differentiation diagnosis of abnormity detected by ultrasound findings (e.g., thickened endometrium or mass in the uterine cavity) is essential and remains challenging in clinical practice. Herein, we identified a metabolic biomarker panel for differentiation diagnosis of EC using machine learning of high-performance serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs) and validated the biological function. We first recorded the high-performance SMFs of 191 EC and 204 Non-EC subjects via particle-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (PELDI-MS). Then, we achieved an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.957-0.968 for EC diagnosis through machine learning of high-performance SMFs, outperforming the clinical biomarker of cancer antigen 125 (CA-125, AUC of 0.610-0.684, P &lt; 0.05). Finally, we identified a metabolic biomarker panel of glutamine, glucose, and cholesterol linoleate with an AUC of 0.901-0.902 and validated the biological function in vitro. Therefore, our work would facilitate the development of novel diagnostic biomarkers for EC in clinics.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001899	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M88147			Plasma instead of serum avoids critical confounding of clinical metabolomics studies by platelets	Metabolomics is an emerging and powerful molecular profiling method supporting clinical investigations. Serum and plasma are commonly used without rational prioritization. Serum is collected after blood coagulation, a complex biochemical process involving active platelet metabolism. This may affect the metabolome and increase the variance as platelet counts and function may vary substantially in individuals. A multi-omics approach systematically investigating the suitability of serum and plasma for clinical studies demonstrated that metabolites correlated well (n=461, R2=0.991), whereas lipid mediators (n=104, R2=0.906) and proteins (n=322, R2=0.860) differed substantially between specimen. Independently, analysis of platelet releasates identified most biomolecules significantly enriched in serum when compared to plasma. A prospective, randomized, controlled parallel group metabolomics trial with acetylsalicylic acid administered for 7 days demonstrated that the apparent drug effects significantly differ depending on analyzed specimen. Only serum analyses of healthy individuals suggested a significant downregulation of TXB2 and 12-HETE, which were specifically formed during coagulation in vitro. Plasma analyses reliably identified acetylsalicylic acid effects on metabolites and lipids occurring in vivo such as a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids. The present data suggests that plasma should be preferred above serum for clinical metabolomics studies as the serum metabolome may be substantially confounded by platelets.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001902	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8VQ65			Providing insight into the mechanism of action of Cationic Lipidated Oligomers (CLOs) using metabolomics	The increasing resistance of clinically relevant microbes against current commercially available antimicrobials underpins the urgent need for alternative and novel treatment strategies. Cationic lipidated oligomers (CLOs) are innovative alternatives to antimicrobial peptides, and have reported antimicrobial potential. An understanding of their antimicrobial mechanism of action is required to rationally design future treatment strategies for CLOs, either in monotherapy or synergistic combinations. In the present study, metabolomics was used to investigate the potential metabolic pathways involved in the mechanisms of antibacterial activity of one CLO, C12-o-(BG-D)-10, which we have previously shown to be effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ATCC 43300. The metabolomes of MRSA ATCC 43300 at 1, 3 and 6 h following treatment with C12-o-(BG-D)-10 (48 µg/mL i.e., 3x MIC) were compared to those of the untreated controls. Our findings reveal that the studied CLO, C12-o-(BG-D)-10, disorganized the bacterial membrane as the first step towards its antimicrobial effect, as evidenced by marked perturbations in the bacterial membrane lipids and peptidoglycan biosynthesis observed at early time points i.e., 1, and 3 h. Central carbon metabolism, and biosynthesis of DNA, RNA, and arginine were also vigorously perturbed, mainly at early time points. Moreover, bacterial cells were under osmotic and oxidative stress across all time points, evident by perturbations of trehalose biosynthesis and pentose phosphate shunt. Overall, this metabolomics study has, for the first time, revealed that the antimicrobial action of C12-o-(BG-D)-10 may potentially stem from the dysregulation of multiple metabolic pathways.

Here, we aimed to characterize the molecular signature of the disease in symptomatic and pre-symptomatic stages of the inflammatory process at the tissue and fecal level. The study is based on two different murine models for colitis. High-resolution Magic Angle Spinning NMR on cryopreserved “intact” colon tissues and LC-MS/MS on colon tissue extracts were used to derive untargeted metabolomics and proteomics information, respectively. Solution NMR was used to derive metabolomic profiles of fecal extracts. By combining metabolomic and proteomic analyses of the tissues, we found increased anaerobic glycolysis, accompanied by altered citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation in inflamed colons; these changes associate with inflammation-induced hypoxia taking place in colon tissues. Pre-symptomatic states can be discriminated from healthy samples before macroscopic inflammation is observed. Different colitis states are characterized by significantly different metabolomic profiles of fecal extracts, attributable to both the dysbiosis characteristic of colitis, as well as the dysregulated tissue metabolism. Strong and distinctive fecal metabolomic signatures can be detected before onset of symptoms. Therefore, untargeted metabolomics of tissues and fecal extracts provides a comprehensive picture of the changes accompanying the disease onset already at pre-clinical stages, highlighting the diagnostic potential of global metabolomics for inflammatory diseases.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001904	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8M718			Thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB) dependent regulation of diurnal hepatic lipid metabolism in adult male mice	Thyroid hormones (THs) are critical regulators of systemic energy metabolism and homeostasis. In the liver, high TH action protects against steatosis by enhancing cholesterol and triglyceride turnover, with thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB) signaling playing a pivotal role. This study probed the potential interaction between THRB action and another critical regulator of liver energy metabolism, the circadian clock. Liver transcriptome analysis of THRB deficient (THRBKO) mice under normal chow conditions revealed a markedly modest impact of THRB deletion. Temporal transcriptome and lipidome profiling uncovered significant alterations in diurnal metabolic rhythms attributable to THRB deficiency pointing to a pro-steatotic state with elevated levels of cholesterol, tri- and diacylglycerides, and fatty acids. These findings were confirmed by THRB agonization in hepatocytes under steatosis-promoting conditions in vitro.

However, the UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) responsible for flavonol multi-glycosylation have remained elusive. In this study, integrated proteomic and metabolomic analyses were performed to identify potential UGTs involved in flavonol triglycoside biosynthesis. Among the tested recombinant enzymes, rCsUGT75AJ1 exhibited flavonoid 4ʹ-O-glucosyltransferase activity, while rCsUGT75L72 catalyzed glucosylation of flavonoids preferentially at the 3-OH position. Remarkably, rCsUGT73AC15 demonstrated substrate promiscuity and regioselectivity, enabling glucosylation of rutin at multiple positions as well as kaempferol 3-O-rutinoside at the 7-OH position. Expression analysis revealed an inverse correlation between the level of CsUGT73AC15 and rutin abundance across different cultivars, suggesting its involvement in flavonol triglycoside biosynthesis in planta. These findings advance the understanding of flavonol triglycoside biosynthesis in tea plants and provide a foundation for further in-vivo characterization of gene functions.

Moreover, short peptide information in these studies was not investigated. Here, we conducted a comprehensive HILIC-HRMS-based plasma metabolomics study on different population sets, including healthy controls, psoriasis, and urticaria patients. With the aim of identifying potential biomarkers specific to psoriasis, the study design included a discovery step, a validation step, and a further refinement step using urticaria samples. We identified 9 potential biomarkers specific to psoriasis, with 5 being structurally characterized. Two dipeptide biomarkers, γ-GluSer and ThrGly, along with a lysine glycation metabolite, Fruc-Lys, were found to be associated with psoriasis for the first time. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed all these 9 biomarkers with AUC values above 0.80. A biomarker panel comprising ThrGly and Fruc-Lys demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy (AUC=0.95) in distinguishing psoriasis patients from healthy controls.

While many studies in rodents have shown tight associations between the metabolic benefits of BAT and increased whole-body energy expenditure, recent evidence in humans suggests that BAT is protective against Type 2 diabetes independent of body-weight. The mechanism underlying this dissociation remains unclear. Here, we report that impaired mitochondrial catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) in BAT, by deleting mitochondrial BCAA carrier (MBC, SLC25A44), sufficiently attenuated insulin sensitivity without affecting whole-body energy expenditure and body-weight. We found that brown adipocytes catabolized BCAA in the mitochondria as essential nitrogen donors for the biosynthesis of glutamate, alanine, N-acetyl amino acids, and one of the products, glutathione. On the other hand, the contribution of BCAA as a carbon source to the TCA cycle was incremental. Impairment of mitochondrial BCAA nitrogen flux in BAT resulted in increased oxidative stress and decreased insulin signaling in the liver, as well as decreased levels of BCAA-nitrogen derived metabolites in circulation. Notably, a high-fat diet rapidly impaired BCAA catabolism and the synthesis of BCAA-derived metabolites in the BAT, while cold-induced BAT activity is coupled with an active synthesis of these metabolites. Together, the present work uncovers a mechanism through which brown fat regulates metabolic health via BCAA-derived nitrogen carriers that act on the liver, independent of thermogenesis.

Plants are characterized by significant biochemical plasticity and can adjust their metabolism to ensure survival under changing environmental conditions. In the most straightforward way these metabolic shifts can be addressed by the untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach. However, so far this methodology was only minimally employed in studies of Zn-induced metabolic shifts in plants. Moreover, the genus Amaranthus is still not addressed in this respect. Therefore, here we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics study of Zn2+-induced stress responses in Amaranthus caudatus plants. The GC-MS-based study was performed with root and leaf aqueous methanolic extracts after their lyophylization and sequential derivatization with methoxylamine hydrochloride and N-trimethylsilyl-N-methyl trifluoroacetamide. Thereby, 419 derivatives were detected, of which 144 could be putatively annotated. The metabolic shifts in seven-week old A.caudatus plants in response to a seven-day treatment with 300 µmol/L ZnSO4·7H2O in nutrient solution were organ-specific and more pronounced in roots. The most of the responsive metabolites were up-regulated and dominated with sugars and sugar acids. These effects could be attributed to the involvement of these metabolites in osmoregulation, ROS scavenging and complexation of Zn2+ ions. Galactose was the most Zn2+-responsive root sugar that indicated its possible role in the binding of Zn2+ ions to the root cell walls. A 59-fold up-regulation of gluconic acid in roots clearly indicated its involvement in chelation of Zn2+. A high Zn2+–induced up-regulation of salicylic acid in roots and shoots suggested a key role of this hormone in the activation of Zn2+ stress tolerance mechanisms. Thus, our study provides the first insight in the general trends in Zn-induced biochemical rearrangements and main adaptive metabolic shifts in A. caudatus plants.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001911	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8Q148			Investigative needle core biopsies for multi-omics in Glioblastoma	Glioblastoma (GBM) is a primary brain cancer with an abysmal prognosis and few effective therapies. The ability to investigate the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment would greatly enhance both our understanding of disease response and progression, as well as the delivery and impact of therapeutics. Stereotactic biopsies are a routine surgical procedure performed primarily for diagnostic histopathologic purposes. The role of investigative biopsies – tissue sampling for the purpose of understanding tumor microenvironmental responses to treatment using integrated multi-modal molecular analyses (‘Multi-omics”) has yet to be defined. Here we adapt stereotactic needle core biopsy tissue for highly resolved multi-omics analysis methods including single cell RNA sequencing, spatial-transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, T-cell clonotype analysis, and MHC Class I immunopeptidomics. Biopsy tissue was obtained from a single patient with recurrent GBM during one procedure. In a second patient, we analyzed multi-regional core biopsies to decipher spatial and genomic variance. Finally in a separate cohort of patients we investigated the utility of stereotactic biopsies as a method for generating patient derived xenograft models. Dataset integration across modalities showed good correspondence between spatial modalities and highlighted immune cell associated metabolic pathways and poor correlation between RNA expression and the tumor MHC Class I immunopeptidome. In conclusion, stereotactic needle biopsy cores are of sufficient quality for the purposes of investigative biopsy and can generate multi-omics data, providing data rich insight into a patient’s disease process and tumor immune microenvironment and could be of potential value in evaluating treatment responses.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001913	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8FH9H			Attenuation of Helicobacter pylori VacA toxin-induced cell death by modulation of intracellular taurine metabolism	Colonization of the human stomach with H. pylori strains producing active forms of a secreted toxin (VacA) is associated with an increased risk of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer, compared to colonization with strains producing hypoactive forms of VacA. Previous studies have shown that VacA causes cell vacuolation and mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, we sought to define the cellular metabolic consequences of VacA intoxication. Untargeted metabolomic analyses revealed that several hundred metabolites were significantly altered in VacA-treated gastroduodenal cells (AGS and AZ-521) compared to control cells. Pathway analysis suggested that VacA caused alterations in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism. Treatment of cells with the purified active s1m1 form of VacA, but not hypoactive s2m1 or Delta_6-27 VacA mutant proteins (defective in membrane channel formation), caused reductions in taurine and hypotaurine levels. Supplementation of the tissue culture medium with taurine or hypotaurine protected AZ-521 cells against VacA-induced cell death. Untargeted global metabolomics of AZ-521 cells or AGS cells intoxicated with VacA in the presence or absence of extracellular taurine showed that taurine was the main intracellular metabolite significantly altered by extracellular taurine supplementation. These results indicate that VacA causes alterations in cellular taurine metabolism and indicate that repletion of taurine is sufficient to attenuate VacA-induced cell death.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which bathes the brain and spinal cord, contains TH as free hormone, or as bound to transthyretin (TTR). Tight TH level regulation in the central nervous system is essential for de-velopmental gene expression that governs neurogenesis, myelination, and synaptogenesis. This integrated function of TH highlights the importance of developing precise and reliable methods for assessing TH levels in CSF. We report an optimized liquid chromatography-mass spectrome-try (LC-MS) based method to measure TH in rodent CSF and serum, applicable to both fresh and frozen samples. Using this new method, we find distinct differences in CSF TH in pregnant dams vs. non-pregnant adults and in embryonic vs. adult CSF. Further, targeted LC-MS metabolic pro-filing uncovers distinct central carbon metabolism in the CSF of these populations. TH detection and metabolite profiling of related metabolic pathways open new avenues of rigorous research into CSF TH and will inform future studies on metabolic alterations in CSF during normal de-velopment.

To standardize metabolomics data analysis and facilitate future computational developments, it is essential is have a set of well-defined templates for common data structures. Here we describe a collection of data structures involved in metabolomics data processing and illustrate how they are utilized in a full-featured Python-centric pipeline. We demonstrate the performance of the pipeline, and the details in annotation and quality control using large-scale LC-MS metabolomics and lipidomics data and LC-MS/MS data. Multiple previously published datasets are also reanalyzed to showcase its utility in biological data analysis. This pipeline allows users to streamline data processing, quality control, annotation, and standardization in an efficient and transparent manner. This work fills a major gap in the Python ecosystem for computational metabolomics. The uploaded datasets include previously unreleased datasets used for the evaluation of this pipeline including two large plasma datasets taken from recipients of one of two herpes zoster vaccines, analyzed as 17 separate batches, and a lipidomics dataset collected on a subset of these patients.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001917	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8XH8G			Dynamic exometabolomics reveals metabolic adaptations of Staphylococcus epidermidis to pH-mimicking skin and bloodstream	A common human skin coloniser, Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE), is often the cause of infections associated with medical devices. Strains that retain this pathogenic and commensal potential coexist in human skin, belonging to clonal lineages A/C and B, respectively. The pH is an abiotic factor that changes during infection when SE is transferred from host skin to blood. However, pathogenicity mechanisms are poorly understood in this organism and recognizing how it deals with increments of pH, is relevant to design effective prevention and treatment strategies against SE infections. To investigate the metabolic adaptations of A/C and B representative strains to an increase in pH, we mimicked the pH conditions of skin and blood (5.5 and 7.4). Biomass formation, growth media pH and 1H-NMR exometabolomic data were measured until the stationary phase was reached, at the two selected pH values. Higher biomass was reached for both strains when grown at pH 7.4. For all experimental conditions, media pH significantly changed during growth, revealing several pH adaptation mechanisms. SE metabolism relies on saccharides and amino acids uptake, citric acid cycle, mixed acid and alcoholic fermentations at a higher extent in blood than at skin pH. This study highlighted accumulation of extracellular formate by the pathogenic strain at blood pH, consistent with the absence of a formate dehydrogenase gene in this strain. This, most likely constitutes a virulence factor that, together with higher media acidification, impacts on host invasion. This work depicts the relevance of specific metabolic processes in determining SE commensalism and pathogenicity, thus providing helpful information towards new design strategies against SE infections.

Changes in eCSF composition due to inflammation can impact brain function. We recently identified an abnormal cytokine signature in eCSF following maternal immune activation (MIA), a mouse model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We hypothesized that MIA leads to other alterations in eCSF composition and employed untargeted metabolomics to profile changes in the eCSF metabolome in mice after inducing MIA with polyI:C. We report these data here as a resource, including a comprehensive MS1 and MS2 reference dataset, and present additional datasets comparing two mouse strains (CD-1 and C57Bl/6) and two developmental time points (E12.5 and E14.5). Targeted metabolomics further validated changes in eCSF upon MIA. We show a significant elevation of glucocorticoids and kynurenine pathway related metabolites. Both pathways are relevant for suppressing inflammation or could be informative as disease biomarkers. Our resource should inform future mechanistic studies regarding the etiology of MIA neuropathology and roles and contributions of eCSF metabolites to brain development.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001919	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8P13K			Phospholipase D regulates PIEZO2 channels via formation of phosphatidic acid	Mechanosensitive PIEZO2 ion channels play roles in touch, proprioception, and inflammatory pain. Currently, there are no small molecule inhibitors that selectively inhibit PIEZO2 over PIEZO1. The TMEM120A protein was shown to inhibit PIEZO2 while leaving PIEZO1 unaffected. Here we find that TMEM120A expression elevates cellular levels of phosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), aligning with its structural resemblance to lipid-modifying enzymes. Intracellular application of phosphatidic acid or LPA inhibited PIEZO2, but not PIEZO1 activity. Extended extracellular exposure to the non-hydrolyzable phosphatidic acid and LPA analogue carbocyclic phosphatidic acid (ccPA) also inhibited PIEZO2. Optogenetic activation of phospholipase D (PLD), responsible for phosphatidic acid generation, inhibited PIEZO2, but not PIEZO1. Conversely, inhibiting PLD led to increased PIEZO2 activity and increased mechanical sensitivity in mice in behavioral experiments. These findings unveil lipid regulators that selectively target PIEZO2 over PIEZO1, and identify the PLD pathway as a regulator of PIEZO2 activity.

Identification of such mutation-associated metabolites will facilitate developing treatment strategies for cancers, but is challenging due to the large number of metabolites in a cell and the presence of multiple genes associated with cancer development. Results Here we report the development of a computational workflow that predicts metabolite-gene-pathway sets. Metabolite-gene-pathway sets present metabolites and metabolic pathways significantly associated with specific somatic mutations in cancers. The computational workflow uses both cancer patient-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) and mutation data to generate metabolite-gene-pathway sets. A GEM is a computational model that predicts reaction fluxes at a genome scale, and can be constructed in a cell-specific manner by using omics data. The computational workflow is first validated by comparing the resulting metabolite-gene pairs with multi-omics data (i.e., mutation data, RNA-seq data, and metabolome data) from acute myeloid leukemia and renal cell carcinoma samples collected in this study. The computational workflow is further validated by evaluating the metabolite-gene-pathway sets predicted for 18 cancer types, by using RNA-seq data publicly available, in comparison with the reported studies. Therapeutic potential of the resulting metabolite-gene-pathway sets is also discussed. Conclusions Validation of the metabolite-gene-pathway set-predicting computational workflow indicates that a decent number of metabolites and metabolic pathways appear to be significantly associated with specific somatic mutations. The computational workflow and the resulting metabolite-gene-pathway sets will help identify novel oncometabolites, and also suggest cancer treatment strategies.

Following the primary injury phase, TBI is characterized by com-plex secondary cascades that involve altered homeostasis and metabolism, faulty signaling, neu-roinflammation, and lipid dysfunction. The objectives of the present study were to (1) assess po-tential correlations between lipidome and cytokine changes after closed-head mild TBI (mTBI), and (2) examine reproducibility of our acute lipidomic profiles following TBI. Cortices from 54 Sprague Dawley male and female rats were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in both positive and negative ionization modes and multiplex cytokine analysis after single (smTBI) or repetitive (rmTBI) closed-head impacts, or sham conditions. Tissue age was a variable, given that two cohorts (n= 26 and n=28) were initially run a year-and-a-half apart, creating inter-batch variations. We annotated the lipidome datasets using an in-house data dictionary based on exact masses of precursor and fragment ions and removed features with statis-tically significant differences between sham control batches. Our results indicate that lipids with high fold change between injury groups moderately correlate with the cytokines eotaxin, IP-10, and TNF-a. Additionally, we show a significant decrease of the pro-inflammatory markers, IL-1b and IP-10, TNF-a, and RANTES in the rmTBI samples relative to sham control. We discuss the major challenges in correlating high dimensional lipidomic data with functional cytokine profiles and the implications for understanding the biological significance of two related but disparate analysis modes in the study of TBI, an inherently heterogeneous neurological disorder.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001925	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8WM7T			Cellular adaptation to cancer therapy along a resistance continuum	Recent research has shed light on the role of non-genetic plasticity in transient drug tolerance and the acquisition of stable resistance. However, the dynamics of cell state transitions occurring in the adaptation to cancer therapies remain elusive and require a systems-level longitudinal framework. Here we demonstrate that resistance develops through trajectories of cell state transitions accompanied by a progressive increase in cell fitness, which we denote the ‘resistance continuum’. This cellular adaptation involves a step-wise assembly of gene expression programs and epigenetically reinforced cell states underpinned by phenotypic plasticity stress adaptation and metabolic reprogramming. Through systematic genetic perturbations, we identify an acquisition of progressive metabolic dependencies, exposing a spectrum of vulnerabilities that can be potentially exploited therapeutically. The concept of the resistance continuum highlights the dynamic nature of cellular adaptation and calls for complementary therapies directed at the mechanisms underlying adaptive cell state transitions.

Here, a multiplatform mass spectrometry-based approach was used for metabolomic and lipidomic profiling of human plasma samples from Long COVID patients (n=40) to reveal mitochondrial dysfunction when compared with individuals fully recovered from acute mild COVID-19 (n=40). Untargeted metabolomic analysis using CE-ESI(+/–)-TOF-MS and GC-Q-MS was performed. Additionally, a lipidomic analysis using LC-ESI(+/–)-QTOF-MS based on an in-house library revealed 471 lipid species identified with high confidence annotation level. The integration of complementary analytical platforms has allowed a comprehensive metabolic and lipidomic characterization of plasma alterations in Long COVID disease that found 46 relevant metabolites which allowed to discriminate between Long COVID and fully recovered patients. We report specific metabolites altered in Long COVID, mainly related to a decrease in the amino acid metabolism and ceramide plasma levels, and an increase in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, reinforcing the evidence of an impaired mitochondrial function. The most relevant alterations shown in this study will help to better understand the insights of Long COVID syndrome by providing a deeper knowledge of the metabolomic basis of the pathology.

One of the most significant risk factors for heart disease is ageing. However, we do not understand how the human heart changes with age. Taking advantage of a unique set of pre-mortem, cryopreserved, non-diseased human hearts, we performed multi-omic analyses (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics), coupled with biological computational modelling in younger (&lt;25 years old) and older hearts (&gt;50years old) to describe the molecular landscape of human cardiac ageing. In older hearts, we observed a downregulation of proteins involved in calcium signalling and of the contractile apparatus itself. In addition, we found a potential counteractive upregulation of central carbon generation of fuel, upregulation of glycolysis and increases in long-chain fatty acids. This is the first molecular data set of normal human cardiac ageing, which may have important implications for the development of age-related heart disease.

If GFRAL+ neurons acutely regulate glucose and energy homeostasis is however underexplored. Here, we report that cell-specific activation of GFRAL+ neurons using a variety of techniques causes a torpor-like state, including hypothermia, the release of stress hormones, a shift from glucose to lipid oxidation, and impaired insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance and skeletal muscle glucose uptake but augmented glucose uptake in visceral fat. Metabolomic analysis of blood and transcriptomics of muscle and fat indicate alterations in ketogenesis, insulin signaling, adipose tissue differentiation and mitogenesis, and energy fluxes. Our findings reveal that acute GFRAL+ neuron activation induces endocrine and gluco- and thermoregulatory responses associated with nausea and torpor. While chronic activation of GFRAL signaling promotes weight loss in obesity, these results show that acute activation of GFRAL+ neurons causes hypothermia and hyperglycemia.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001931	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M84428			Complete absence of GLUT1 does not impair human terminal erythroid differentiation	The Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is one of the most abundant proteins within the erythrocyte membrane and is required for glucose and dehydroascorbic acid (Vitamin C precursor) transport. It is widely recognized as a key protein for red cell structure, function, and metabolism. Previous reports highlighted the importance of GLUT1 activity within these uniquely glycolysis-dependent cells, in particular for increasing antioxidant capacity needed to avoid irreversible damage from oxidative stress in humans. However, studies of glucose transporter roles in erythroid cells are complicated by species-specific differences between humans and mice. Here, using CRISPRmediated gene editing of immortalized erythroblasts and adult CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, we generate committed human erythroid cells completely deficient in expression of GLUT1. We show that absence of GLUT1 does not impede human erythroblast proliferation, differentiation, or enucleation. This work demonstrates for the first-time generation of enucleated human reticulocytes lacking GLUT1. The GLUT1-deficient reticulocytes possess no tangible alterations to membrane composition or deformability in reticulocytes. Metabolomic analyses of GLUT1-deficient reticulocytes reveal hallmarks of reduced glucose import, downregulated metabolic processes and upregulated AMPK-signalling, alongside alterations in antioxidant metabolism, resulting in increased osmotic fragility and metabolic shifts indicative of higher oxidant stress. Despite detectable metabolic changes in GLUT1 deficient reticulocytes, the absence of developmental phenotype, detectable proteomic compensation or impaired deformability comprehensively alters our understanding of the role of GLUT1 in red blood cell structure, function and metabolism. It also provides cell biological evidence supporting clinical consensus that reduced GLUT1 expression does not cause anaemia in GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001932	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M80B0B			Untargeted Metabolomics Reveals Signatures of a Healthy Lifestyle	This cross-sectional study investigated differences in the plasma metabolome in two groups of adults that were of similar age but varied markedly in body composition and dietary and physical activity patterns. Study participants included 52 adults in the lifestyle group (LIFE) (28 males, 24 females) and 52 in the control group (CON) (27 males, 25 females). The results using an extensive untargeted UPLC-HRMS analysis with 10,535 metabolite peaks identified 83 metabolites and 16 metabolic pathways that differentiated LIFE and CON groups. A novel metabolite signature of positive lifestyle habits emerged from this analysis highlighted by lower plasma levels of numerous bile acids, an amino acid profile characterized by higher histidine and lower glutamic acid, glutamine, β-alanine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and proline, an elevated vitamin D status, higher levels of beneficial fatty acids and gut microbiome catabolism metabolites from plant substrates, and reduced levels of N-glycan degradation metabolites and environmental contaminants. This study established that the plasma metabolome is strongly associated with body composition and lifestyle habits. The robust lifestyle metabolite signature identified in this study is consistent with an improved life expectancy and a reduced risk for chronic disease.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001933	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8VM8W			Inhibition of Asparagine Synthetase Effectively Retards Polycystic Kidney Disease Progression.	Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by bilateral cyst formation. We showed that PKD cells and kidneys display metabolic alterations, including the Warburg effect and glutaminolysis, sustained in vitro by the enzyme asparagine synthetase (ASNS). Here, we used antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) against ASNS in orthologous and slowly progressive PKD murine models and show that treatment leads to a drastic reduction of total kidney volume (measured by MRI) and a prominent rescue of renal function in the mouse. Mechanistically, the upregulation of an ATF4-ASNS axis in PKD is driven by the amino acid response (AAR) branch of the integrated stress response (ISR). Metabolic profiling of PKD control kidneys treated with ASNS-ASOScr-ASO revealed major changes in the mutants, several of which are rescued by ASNS silencing in vivo. Indeed, ASNS drives glutamine-dependent de novo pyrimidine synthesis and proliferation in cystic epithelia. Notably, while several metabolic pathways were completely corrected by ASNS-ASO, glycolysis was only partially restored. Accordingly, combining the glycolytic inhibitor 2DG with ASNS-ASO further improved efficacy. Our studies identify a new therapeutic target and novel metabolic vulnerabilities in PKD. Altogether, targeted metabolomics analysis performed in Tam-Cre;Pkd1ΔC/flox mouse model kidneys corroborates the central role of ASNS in the metabolic rewiring occurring in PKD, highlighting the therapeutic potential of its inhibition.

Brain glucose hypometabolism is consistently observed in C9-NRE carriers, even at pre-symptomatic stages, although its potential role in disease pathogenesis is unknown. Here, we identified alterations in glucose metabolic pathways and ATP levels in the brains of asymptomatic C9-BAC mice. We found that, through activation of the GCN2 kinase, glucose hypometabolism drives the production of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), impairs the survival of C9 patient-derived neurons, and triggers motor dysfunction in C9-BAC mice. We also found that one of the arginine-rich DPRs (PR) can directly contribute to glucose metabolism and metabolic stress. These findings provide a potential mechanistic link between energy imbalances and C9-ALS/FTD pathogenesis and suggest a feedforward loop model that opens several opportunities for therapeutic intervention.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001935	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8M430			Lipid unsaturation promotes BAX and BAK pore activity during apoptosis	BAX and BAK are proapoptotic members of the BCL2 family that directly mediate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), a central step in apoptosis execution. However, the molecular architecture of the mitochondrial apoptotic pore remains a key open question and especially little is known about the contribution of lipids to MOMP. By performing a comparative lipidomics analysis of the proximal membrane environment of BAK isolated in lipid nanodiscs, we find a significant enrichment of unsaturated species nearby BAK and BAX in apoptotic conditions. We then demonstrate that unsaturated lipids promote BAX pore activity in model membranes, isolated mitochondria and cellular systems, which is further supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Accordingly, the fatty acid desaturase FADS2 not only enhances apoptosis sensitivity, but also the activation of the cGAS/STING pathway downstream mtDNA release. The correlation of FADS2 levels with the sensitization to apoptosis of different lung and kidney cancer cell lines by co-treatment with unsaturated fatty acids supports the relevance of our findings. Altogether, our work provides new insight on how local lipid environment affects BAX and BAK function during apoptosis.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001936	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8GB12			Metabolomics of patients with Plasmodium vivax malaria	Background: Malaria is the leading parasitic disease worldwide, with P. vivax being a major challenge for its control. Several studies have indicated metabolomics as a promising tool for combating the disease. Objective: The study evaluated plasma metabolomic profiles of patients with recurrent and non-recurrent P. vivax malaria in the Brazilian Amazon. Methods: Metabolites extracted from the plasma of P. vivax-infected patients were subjected to LC-MS analysis. Untargeted metabolomics was applied to investigate the metabolic profile of the plasma in the two groups. Results: Overall, 51 recurrent and 59 non-recurrent patients were included in the study. Longitudinal metabolomic analysis revealed 52 and 37 significant metabolite features from the recurrent and non-recurrent participants, respectively. Recurrence was associated with disturbances in eicosanoid metabolism. Comparison between groups suggest alterations in vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, 3-oxo-10-octadecatrienoate β-oxidation, and alkaloid biosynthesis II. Integrative network analysis revealed enrichment of other metabolic pathways for the recurrent phenotype, including the butanoate metabolism, aspartate and asparagine metabolism, and N-glycan biosynthesis. Conclusion: The metabolites and metabolic pathways predicted in our study suggest potential biomarkers of recurrence and provide insights into targets for antimalarial development against P. vivax.

In this project, we manipulated central carbon metabolism using different glucose concentrations and its inhibitors. To understand developmental phenotype of such manipulations, we analysed the levels of intermediates of the glycolytic pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway etc as well as glucose epimers such as fucose, mannose, galactose. We later tested how changes in these metabolite levels affected signalling pathways, important in germ layer fate specification and subsequently their morphogenesis.

While the disorder has primarily neurological presentation, there is limited knowledge about the specific brain-related changes that result from ALG13 deficiency. We used 3D brain organoids derived from fibroblasts of the individuals with ALG13-CDG to probe the brain-specific metabolic changes in ALG13-CDG.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001941	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8TM76			The shutdown of NADH oxidation via Respiratory Complex I mimics fatty acid biosynthesis inhibition	Proliferating cancer cells actively utilize anabolic processes for biomass production, including de novo biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids. The key enzyme of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, fatty acid synthase (FASN), is widely recognized as a promising therapeutic target in cancer and other health conditions. Here, we establish a metabolic signature of FASN inhibition using a panel of pharmacological inhibitors (GSK2194069, TVB-2640, TVB-3166, C75, cerulenin, and Fasnall). We find that the activity of some commonly used FASN inhibitors is inconsistent with the metabolic signature of FASN inhibition (accumulation of malonate, succinate, malonyl coenzyme A, succinyl coenzyme A, and other metabolic perturbations). Moreover, we show that one of these putative FASN inhibitors, Fasnall, is a respiratory Complex I inhibitor that mimics FASN inhibition through NADH accumulation and consequent depletion of the tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites. We demonstrate that Fasnall impairs tumor growth in several oxidative phosphorylation-dependent cancer models, including combination therapy-resistant melanoma patient-derived xenografts. Fasnall administration does not reproduce neurological side effects in mice reported for other Complex I inhibitors. Our results have significant implications for understanding the FASN role in human health and disease and provide evidence of therapeutic potential for Complex I inhibitors with fast systemic clearance. Our findings also highlight the continuing need for validation of small molecule inhibitors to distinguish high-quality chemical probes and to expand the understanding of their application.

The diagnosis of IRD is challenging owing to its phenotypic and genotypic complexity. Metabolomics, the emerging tool investigating comprehensive small molecule constitution of biological samples, provides instantaneous phenotypic information as metabolites reflect both genetic and environmental factors. In this project, we aimed to discover potential biomarkers and establish a diagnosis model for classifying specific IRDs.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001943	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8K43P			Pulmonary maternal immune activation does not extend through the placenta but leads to fetal metabolic adaptation	Maternal immune system activation (MIA) during pregnancy can disrupt the fetal environment, causing postnatal susceptibility to disorders. How the placenta and the fetus respond to acute MIA over time is unknown. Here, we characterized the response to acute maternal pulmonary inflammation across time in maternal and fetal organs using multi-omics. Unlike maternal organs which mounted strong innate immune responses, the placenta upregulated tissue-integrity genes, likely to prevent fetal exposure to infections, and downregulated growth-associated genes. Subsequently, the placenta upregulated biosynthesis and endoplasmic reticulum stress genes in order to return to homeostasis. These responses likely protected the fetus, since we observed no immune response in fetal liver. Instead, likely due to nutrient depletion, the fetal liver displayed metabolic adaptations, including increases in lipids containing docosahexaenoic acid, crucial for fetal brain development. Our study shows, for the first time, the integrated temporal response to pulmonary MIA across maternal and fetal organs. The study contains data from three different sources: Maternal liver samples, Fetal liver and Maternal blood.

Chchd10 knock-in mice harboring a heterozygous S55L mutation (equivalent to human pathogenic S59L) develop a fatal mitochondrial cardiomyopathy caused by CHCHD10 aggregation and proteotoxic mitochondrial integrated stress response (mtISR). In mutant hearts, mtISR is accompanied by a metabolic rewiring characterized by increased reliance on glycolysis rather than fatty acid oxidation. To counteract this metabolic rewiring, heterozygous S55L mice were subjected to chronic high fat diet (HFD) to decrease insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake and enhance fatty acid utilization in the heart. HFD ameliorated the ventricular dysfunction of mutant hearts and significantly extended the survival of mutant female mice affected by severe pregnancy-induced cardiomyopathy. Gene expression profiles confirmed that HFD increased fatty acid utilization and ameliorated cardiomyopathy markers. Importantly, HFD also decreased accumulation of aggregated CHCHD10 in the S55L heart, suggesting activation of quality control mechanisms. Overall, our findings indicate that metabolic therapy can be effective in mitochondrial cardiomyopathies associated with proteotoxic stress.

In this pilot study, we performed global untargeted salivary metabolomics. We focused on salivary metabolomics as oral mucosa is the initial interface between the triggering antigens and the host mucosal immune system,9 saliva is rich yet understudied biofluid, and saliva can be collected safely, rapidly, and non-invasively (compared to esophageal and plasma samples) making it uniquely suited for testing pediatric populations.10 Our primary aim was to gain novel insights into the upstream metabolomic alterations in pediatric EoE by profiling salivary metabolome in children with EoE, and our secondary aim was to assess the translational potential of salivary metabolites.

Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death and is associated with anti-cancer therapeutic efficacy. Further investigations are required to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Ferroptosis-resistant GC cell lines are constructed. Dysregulated mRNAs between ferroptosis-resistant and parental cell lines are identified. The expression of SOX13/SCAF1 is manipulated in GC cell lines where relevant biological and molecular analyses are performed. Molecular docking and computational screening are performed to screen potential inhibitors of SOX13. We show that SOX13 boosts protein remodeling of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes by directly transactivating SCAF1. This leads to increased supercomplexes (SCs) assembly, mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial energetics and chemo- and immune-resistance. Zanamivir, reverts the ferroptosis-resistant phenotype via directly targeting SOX13 and promoting TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of SOX13. Here we show, SOX13/SCAF1 are important in ferroptosis-resistance, and targeting SOX13 with zanamivir has therapeutic potential. We conducted untargeted metabolomic analysis of Erastin-resis SNU-668 cells transfected with shRNA-SOX13 or shRNA-NC.

Uncovering the metabolome of circulating human CD4+ T effector memory (Teff) and T regulatory (Treg) cells would enable better understanding of Th2-driven diseases, such as allergy or asthma. Here, we demonstrated that in healthy humans, energy metabolism and functions of memory CD4+ Teff cells mainly relied on amino acids, whereas Treg cells predominantly used fatty acids. Arginine and phenylalanine increased T cell receptorinduced glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in total and memory CD4+ T cells, but high levels of phenylalanine limited CD4+ T cell proliferation via disrupting mitochondrial respiration and activation of L-phenylalanine oxidase, IL4I1. Accordingly, lowest levels of phenylalanine were linked with the pathogenic Th2a cells, and impaired Treg cells in patients with the most severe forms of allergies. It all suggests that phenylalanine is a metabolic checkpoint of pathogenic Th2 cells development.

We performed metabolomic profiling on 4 cohorts: 1) patients with septic shock, 2) patients with bacteremia without sepsis, 3) cardiogenic shock, and 4) healthy ambulatory controls. We found a set of metabolites that out outperformed lactate in their ability to distinguish survivors and non-survivors of sepsis.

Along with these changes are alterations in cellular metabolism that promote energy production to deal with this stress. Utilizing laser-doppler perfusion monitoring coupled with iontophoresis (LDPMI) in patients undergoing corrective heart surgery, we hypothesized that temporal, untargeted metabolomics could be performed to assess the link between metabolism and vascular function. The data give insight into the metabolic landscape of children undergoing CPB for corrective heart surgery and provide detail into how these metabolites relate to physiological aberrations in the vasculature.

To-date, studies have largely focused on impacts of antibiotics on large intestinal and fecal microbiota. Here, we employ a GI-wide integrated multiomic approach to reveal that amoxicillin (AMX) treatment reduces overall bacterial abundance, bile salt hydrolase activity and unconjugated bile acids in the small intestine (SI). An accompanying loss of fatty acids and increase in acyl-carnitines in the large intestine corresponded with spatially-distinct expansions of proteobacteria. Parasutterella excrementihominis utilized fatty acid biosynthesis, becoming dominant in the SI while multiple Klebsiella species employed fatty acid oxidation during expansion in the large intestine. Depletion of bile acids and lipids may contribute to AMX-induced dysbiosis in the lower GI. To test this, we demonstrate that restoration of unconjugated bile acids can mitigate losses of commensals in the large intestine while also inhibiting the expansion of Proteobacteria during AMX treatment.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001954	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M84X6Q			Mitochondrial complex I promotes kidney cancer metastasis	Most kidney cancers display metabolic dysfunction but how this relates to cancer progression in humans is unknown. We infused 13C-labeled nutrients during surgical tumour resection in over 80 patients with kidney cancer. Labeling from [U-13C]glucose varies across subtypes, indicating that the kidney environment alone cannot account for all metabolic reprogramming in these tumours. Compared to the adjacent kidney, clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) display suppressed labelling of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates in vivo and in organotypic cultures ex vivo, indicating that suppressed labeling is tissue intrinsic. Infusions of [1,2-13C]acetate and [U-13C]glutamine in patients, coupled with measurements of respiration in mitochondria isolated from kidneys and tumours, reveal electron transport chain (ETC) defects in ccRCC. However, ccRCC metastases unexpectedly have enhanced TCA cycle labeling compared to primary ccRCCs, indicating a divergent metabolic program during metastasis in patients. In mice, stimulating respiration or NADH recycling in kidney cancer cells is sufficient to promote metastasis, while inhibiting ETC complex I decreases metastasis. These findings indicate that metabolic properties and liabilities evolve during kidney cancer progression in humans, and that mitochondrial function is limiting for metastasis but not for growth at the original site.

Here we show that the compound MMV1557817 is a selective, nanomolar inhibitor of both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax aminopeptidases M1 and M17, leading to inhibition of end stage haemoglobin digestion in asexual parasites. MMV1557817 can kill sexual stage P. falciparum, is active against murine malaria and did not show any shift in activity against a panel of parasites resistant to other antimalarials. MMV1557817-resistant P. falciparum exhibited a slow growth rate that was quickly outcompeted by wild type parasites and were sensitised to the current clinical drug, artemisinin. Overall, these results confirm MMV1557817 as a lead compound for further drug development and highlight the potential of dual inhibition of M1 and M17 as an effective multi-species drug targeting strategy.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001956	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8WF0F			Muscle-type specific stress responses explain external ophthalmoplegia in mitochondrial disease	Mitochondrial dysfunctions elicit progressive tissue-specific stress responses that can be protective or deleterious. Here, we show that even different muscles of an individual react differently to mitochondrial disease. In mitochondrial myopathy (MM), the extraocular muscles (EOMs) are affected first, followed by exercise intolerance in the large lower limb muscles. Both muscle types show clear signs of respiratory chain deficiency. However, the limbs upregulate the mitochondrial integrated stress response (ISRmt) that drives glucose carbons to anabolic repair pathways, while EOMs present no signs of ISRmt. In contrast, in EOMs, Pdk4 activation inhibits pyruvate metabolism, while beta-oxidation of fatty acids is induced - despite the reliance of beta-oxidation on a functional respiratory chain for ATP production. The data suggest that the inability to upregulate ISRmt and consequent deleterious fuel choices sensitize EOMs to early weakness and atrophy, explaining ophthalmoplegia, the most common MM sign. The distinct responses to disease even in muscles of a single individual predict different responses to treatment, which is essential knowledge when designing interventions.

Despite advancements, current treatments encounter obstacles such as chemotherapy resistance and adverse effects due to non-selective targeting. DNA Minor Groove Binders (MGBs) present promising alternatives, targeting DNA structure without causing permanent damage. In this study, two novel MGB compounds were synthesized, MGB30 and MGB32, resembling distamycin, a natural DNA-binding agent. These compounds bind reversibly to the DNA minor groove, influencing DNA structure and inhibiting cancer growth-related enzymes. Our study aims to explore the unique effects of MGB30 and MGB32 on the metabolomic profiles of treated HCT-116 cells using TIMS-QTOF-UHPLC-MS. Objectives include comprehensive analysis, comparison of effects, identification of altered pathways, and insights into MGB compound mechanisms. Additionally, we established four biological replicates for each treatment condition. Advanced statistical analyses, including the two-tailed independent Student's t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), were utilized to minimize false discoveries. Our analysis generated a comprehensive dataset from 12 samples, identifying 75 distinct metabolites. The significance of this study lies in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of action of MGB30 and MGB32, crucial for their development as CRC drug candidates.

This study utilized metagenomics, NMR- and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, and biochemical assays to analyze the gut microbiome composition and function, as well as the physiological and metabolic effects of early-life exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF) in conventional, germ-free (GF), and Ahr-null mice. The impact of TCDF on Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) in vitro was assessed using optical density (OD 600), flow cytometry, transcriptomics, and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. TCDF-exposed mice exhibited disruption in the gut microbiome community structure and function, characterized by lower abundances of A. muciniphila, lower levels of cecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), and a reduction in gut hormones GLP-1 and PYY. Importantly, microbial and metabolic phenotypes associated with early-life POP exposure were transferable to GF recipients in the absence of POP carry-over. In addition, AHR-independent interactions between POPs and the microbiota were observed, significantly affected the growth, physiology, gene expression, and metabolic activity of A. muciniphila, resulting in suppressed activity along the ILA pathway.

Briefly, KPC FC1245 cells were genetically engineered using doxycycline inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system platform to target specifically cytidine deaminase (sgCda). sgCda and the control sgNT were then orthotopically injected in the head of the pancreas of 8-10 weeks old C57BL/6J female mice. When the tumor weight reached approximately 0.2-0.4g, mice were sacrificed and tumor interstitial fluid was collected as reported in the Collection section of this study. Standard curves for glutamine, cytidine, uridine, glucose, UTP and UDP were prepared and extracted along with the interstitial fluid samples. The concentrations of glutamine, cytidine, uridine, UDP and UTP were measured by LC-MS, and glucose was measured by GC-MS. A decrease in uridine content, and accordingly in UDP and UTP, and a concomitant accumulation of cytidine was observed in sgCda tumors. On the other hand, no differences were observed in glucose and glutamine abundance.

This study aimed to profile the metabolic differences of colorectal cancer tissues (CCT) at different stages and sites, as compared with their adjacent noncancerous tissues (ANT), to investigate the temporal and spatial heterogeneities of metabolic characterization. Our NMR-based metabolomics fingerprinting revealed that many of the metabolite levels were significantly altered in CCT compared to ANT and esophageal cancer tissues, indicating deregulations of glucose metabolism, one-carbon metabolism, glutamine metabolism, amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, TCA cycle, choline metabolism, etc. A total of five biomarker metabolites, including glucose, glutamate, alanine, valine and histidine, were identified to distinguish between early and advanced stages of CCT. Metabolites that distinguish the different anatomical sites of CCT include glucose, glycerol, glutamine, inositol, succinate, and citrate. Those significant metabolic differences in CRC tissues at different pathological stages and sites suggested temporal and spatial heterogeneities of metabolic characterization in CCT, providing a metabolic foundation for further study on biofluid metabolism in CRC early detection.

Metabolic networks based on these data can help uncover disease-related perturbations across interconnected pathways. Objective: Identify metabolic disturbances associated with PD in the PEG population-based study using untargeted metabolomics. Methods: We provide serum-based untargeted metabolomics data derived from liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS).

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001965	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8QQ8P			New class of heterospirocyclic compounds present strong and rapid activity against artemisinin- and multidrug-resistant P. falciparum parasites	Malaria remains a significant health burden and a leading contributor to global mortality rates. Increasing drug resistance creates an urgent demand for novel treatment options. We have synthesised a new class of heterospirocyclic compounds with novel chemical connectivities. Compounds 25 and 26 display antimalarial activity within 24 h and have similar potency against a panel of drug-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent of human malaria parasites, including parasites resistant to the frontline artemisinin antimalarials. C25 and C26 do not induce major toxicity in kidney- and hepatic-derived human cell lines, highlighting their specificity. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of P. falciparum infected red blood cells revealed that the mechanism of action of C25 involves disruption of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway and haemoglobin catabolism. These heterospirocyclic compounds represent a promising opportunity for antimalarial drug development and could prove relevant against drug resistant malaria.

The Study Of Urban and Rural CD Evolution (SOURCE, n=380) has considered diet-omics domains simultaneously to detect complex interactions and identify potential beneficial and pathogenic factors linked with rural-urban transition and CD. We characterize exposures, diet, ileal transcriptomics, metabolomics, and microbiome in newly diagnosed CD patients and controls in rural and urban China and Israel. We show that time spent by rural residents in urban environments is linked with changes in gut microbial composition and metabolomics, which mirror those seen in CD. Ileal transcriptomics highlights personal metabolic and immune gene expression modules, that are directly linked to potential protective dietary exposures (coffee, manganese, vitamin D), fecal metabolites, and the microbiome. Bacteria-associated metabolites are primarily linked with host immune modules, whereas diet-linked metabolites are associated with host epithelial metabolic functions.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001967	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8G72D			Loss of dihydroceramide desaturase drives neurodegeneration by disrupting endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplet homeostasis in glial cells	Dihydroceramide desaturases convert dihydroceramides to ceramides, the precursors of all complex sphingolipids. Reduction of DEGS1 dihydroceramide desaturase function causes pediatric neurodegenerative disorder hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-18 (HLD-18). We discovered that infertile crescent (ifc), the Drosophila DEGS1 homolog, is expressed primarily in glial cells to promote CNS development by guarding against neurodegeneration. Loss of ifc causes massive dihydroceramide accumulation and severe morphological defects in cortex glia, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) expansion, failure of neuronal ensheathment, and lipid droplet depletion. RNAi knockdown of the upstream ceramide synthase schlank in glia of ifc mutants rescues ER expansion, suggesting dihydroceramide accumulation in the ER drives this phenotype. RNAi knockdown of ifc in glia but not neurons drives neuronal cell death, suggesting that ifc function in glia promotes neuronal survival. Our work identifies glia as the primary site of disease progression in HLD-18 and may inform on juvenile forms of ALS, which also feature elevated dihydroceramide levels.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001969	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M86Q81			Spatial Lipidomics Maps Brain Alterations Associated with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global public health problem with 50-60 million incidents per year, most of which are considered mild (mTBI) and many of these repetitive (rmTBI). Despite their massive implications, the pathologies of mTBI and rmTBI are not fully understood, with a paucity of information on brain lipid dysregulation following mild injury event(s). To gain more insight on mTBI and rmTBI pathology, a non-targeted spatial lipidomics workflow utilizing ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry imaging was developed to map brain region-specific lipid alterations in rats following injury. Discriminant multivariate models were created for regions of interest including the hippocampus, cortex, and corpus callosum to pinpoint lipid species that differentiated between injured and sham animals. A multivariate model focused on the hippocampus region differentiated injured brain tissues with an area under the curve of 0.994 using only four lipid species. Lipid classes that were consistently discriminant included polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phosphatidylcholines (PC), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), LPC-plasmalogens (LPC-P) and PC potassium adducts. Many of the polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing PC and LPC-P selected have never been previously reported as altered in mTBI. The observed lipid alterations indicate that neuroinflammation and , oxidative stress and disrupted sodium-potassium pumps are important pathologies that could serve to explain cognitive deficits associated with rmTBI. Therapeutics which target or attenuate these pathologies may be beneficial to limit persistent damage following a mild brain injury event.

Mitochondrial respiration is essential for survival and function of CAR-T cells, but developing strategies to specifically enhance mitochondrial respiration has been challenging. Here we identify MCJ/DnaJC15, an endogenous negative regulator of mitochondrial Complex I, as a metabolic target to enhance mitochondrial respiration in CD8 CAR-T cells. Loss of MCJ in CD8 CAR-T cells increases their in vitro and in vivo efficacy against mouse B cell leukemias. MCJ deficiency in TCR- specific CD8 cells also increases their efficacy against solid tumors in vivo. Furthermore, we reveal that human CD8 cells express MCJ and that silencing MCJ expression increases mitochondrial metabolism and anti-tumor activity of human CAR-T cells. Thus, targeting MCJ to enhance mitochondrial metabolism is a promising therapeutic strategy to improve the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapies.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001971	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8Z72R			Comberhincive Chemometric Metabolomic Profile for Maple Syrup Urine Disease Sick Patients	Abstract: Background: A malfunction in the activity of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKAD) complex results in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), a genetically inherited illness. Three amino acids—leucine, isoleucine, and valine—are typically broken down by branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. Abnormal activity in this process, therefore, can affect vital body systems and result in metabolic dysregulation associated with the consequences of this disease. The therapy and follow-up of ill MSUD patients are greatly aided by many researched endogenous metabolites as well as dysregulated biomarkers and pathways. Objectives: Our goal is to add to the increasing knowledge of information about sick MSUD and the pathways that are involved in improving patient outcomes by utilizing untargeted metabolomics to examine the unique profile of MSUD in sick MSUD patients. Methods: This study evaluated the metabolic changes in the dry blood spot (DBS) of 14 sick MSUD patients and 14 healthy controls utilizing untargeted metabolomics studies performed with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Findings: Based on metabolomics analysis,7754 metabolites were found to be highly dysregulated.Out of them,3716 were up-regulated and 4038 were down-regulated.1557 of the annotated metabolites were found to be endogenous metabolites. The research found possible biomarkers for MSUD, including Glutathioselenol and dUDP, which were elevated in sick MSUD relative to healthy controls and LysoPI downregulated in sick MSUD. Moreover, the Sphingolipid metabolism, selenocompound metabolism and porphyrin metabolism pathways were the most impacted in sick MSUD. In summary, our findings shows that metabolomics is a noninvasive approach to understanding the pathophysiology of the medical condition and a potentially useful technique for assessing novel biomarkers in the early detection of sick MSUD.Further research is required regarding the relationship of these dysregulated metabolites to compromised pathways.

The metabolome data collection began on the day of flowering (0 days post-anthesis), and continued for 7, 16, 30, 50, 55, and 60 DPA. This comprehensive dataset paved the way for future studies on metabolite changes and biological processes in chili peppers throughout their life cycle.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001973	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8PQ8C			Assessment and partial characterization of candidate genes in dihydrochalcone and arbutin biosynthesis in an apple-pear hybrid by de novo transcriptome assembly	The goal of the study was to determine the phenolic profile of young and old leaves, as well as fruit of apple (Malus x domestica), pear (Pyrus communis) and an intergeneric apple-pear hybrid. Three independent replicates were obtained for each genotype from the germplasm collection at Fondazione Edmund Mach (Italy) and analyzed by a phenolic targeted LC/MS-MS method. In addition, candidate genes retrieved from a de novo transcriptome assembly were tested in recombinant proteins (n = 3) to determine the conversion of hydroquinone to arbutin. Combining RNA-Seq, in silico functional annotation prediction, targeted gene expression analysis and expression – metabolite correlations with the data submitted to Metabolomics Workbench, we identified candidate genes for functional characterisation, resulting in the identification of active arbutin synthases in the hybrid and parental genotypes. We found that the putative arbutin synthases of pear (PcAS) and apple-pear hybrid (HybAS) were able to convert hydroquinone into arbutin. Interestingly, also one out of two putative arbutin synthases isolated from apple (MdAS1) could produce arbutin in vitro. However, the metabolomic profiling of phenolic compounds showed that apple lacks of arbutin and was found to accumulate the precursor hydroquinone in traces in young and old leaves of apple. Although quercetin was accumulated in similar amounts in the same tissues, a luminiscence-based assay showed that quercetin was converted only 25% compared to activity towards hydroquinone in the tested conditions. In summary, the metabolomic profiling submitted to Metabolomics workbench also shows that: 1) arbutin is accumulated mainly in young leaves of pear, followed by the apple-pear hybrid and was found in traces in apple fruit; 2) rutin was found mainly in pear and apple-pear hybrid tissues; 3) phenolic profile of apple is dominated by phloridzin and undetectable in all pear tissues analyzed, with young leaves being the tissue showing highest accumulation.

MUL1 protein is involved in mitochondrial dynamics, and innate immune response but its primary function might be the regulation of lipogenesis under conditions of nutritional overload. Using metabolic cages, we monitored whole body energy expenditure, metabolism, and thermoregulation of the Mul1(-/-) mice under standard diet (ND) or high fat diet (HFD). We examined the effect of Mul1 inactivation on body weight, HFD-induced adiposity, fatty liver, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. We performed global metabolomics, lipidomic, and genome-wide mRNA sequencing using liver from Mul1(+/+) and Mul1(-/-) animals on HFD. The expression level of key proteins involved in lipogenesis and their regulation in the absence of MUL1 was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. We found that Mul1(-/-) animals have a metabolic phenotype that confers robust resistance to HFD-induced obesity. Several metabolic and lipidomic pathways are perturbed in the liver of Mul1(-/-) animals on HFD, particularly the one driven by Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1), a key regulator of lipid metabolism and obesity. In addition, key enzymes involved in lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation such as ACC1, FASN, AMPK, and CTP1 were also modulated. The concerted deregulation of these enzymes, in the absence of MUL1, causes reduced fat storage and increased fatty acid oxidation. We identified a new function of mitochondrial MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase in the regulation of lipogenesis and adiposity, particularly during conditions of HFD. Inactivation of MUL1 provides resistance to HFD-induced obesity and can be a therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Pathological changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) begin decades before cognitive symptoms appear. Chronic exposure to environmental neurotoxins like manganese (Mn) from sources such as air pollution and water can impact disease development across decades. Mn toxicity can lead to motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms resembling Parkinson's disease, attributed to its accumulation in globus pallidus. In contrast, the impact of chronic lower-level exposures on normal and neuropathological brain function is unknown. We tested whether 10 months of a high Mn diet (2400 ppm) could alter aspects of glutamate signaling in APP/PSEN1 mice to further exacerbate cognitive impairments compared to control fed animals (70 ppm). This study supports the potential role for chronic environmental exposures in the development of Alzheimer’s disease associated neuropathology.

This study scrutinizes a longitudinal cohort of RA, inclusive of follow-ups, alongside OA, UA and ACPA/RF-RA and healthy controls, aiming to discover plasma metabolic markers that can precede RA onset, assess disease activity, and forecast treatment efficacy. Our investigation revealed substantial metabolic alterations at both the pathway and individual metabolite levels across RA, at-risk or RA and healthy control. The drug response predictive models constructed on critical differential metaboites showed optimal performance. Additionally, our longitudinal data sheds light on the molecular impacts on metabolism of csDMARDs in RA.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001977	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85Q8Q			Deep phenotyping of Post-infectious Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome	Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a disabling disorder that may occur following an infection, yet the clinical phenotype is poorly defined, the pathophysiology is unknown, and no disease-modifying treatments are available. We used rigorous criteria to recruit a cohort of post-infectious ME/CFS (PI-ME/CFS) volunteers (n=17) with matched healthy controls (n=21) to conduct deep clinical and biological phenotyping using an extensive battery of tests. Among the many physical and cognitive complaints, one defining feature of PI-ME/CFS was an alteration of effort preference, rather than physical or central fatigue, due to dysfunction of integrative brain regions potentially associated with central catechol pathway dysregulation, with consequences on autonomic functioning and physical deconditioning. Immune profiling suggested chronic antigenic stimulation with increase in naïve and decrease in switched memory B-cells. Alterations in gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and metabolic pathways were consistent with cellular phenotypic studies and demonstrated differences according to sex. Together these clinical abnormalities and biomarker differences provide unique insight into the underlying pathophysiology of PI-ME/CFS, which may guide future intervention.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001978	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8214C			Property and Activity Refinement of Dihydroquinazolinone-3-carboxamides as Orally Efficacious Antimalarials that Target PfATP4	The development of new antimalarial classes is pertinent because of resistance against the current antimalarial treatments. To contribute to the global effort to create new antimalarial therapies, we previously disclosed initial findings on the optimization of the dihydroquinazolinone-3-carboxamide class that targets PfATP4. The preliminary optimization generated analogs, such as 4, that exhibited potent in vitro asexual stage activity but only showed modest oral efficacy in a P. berghei mouse model attributed to its low aqueous solubility and modest metabolic stability. Here we report on correcting these parameters to improve in vivo efficacy. We show that the incorporation of heterocycle systems in the 8-position of the scaffold markedly improved aqueous solubility without a significant loss of asexual parasite activity. Certain configurations of pyrazoles in the 8-position were found to provide the greatest attainable balance between parasite activity, aqueous solubility, and metabolic stability. We were able to show that modifications made to the optimized analogs, such as WJM992 did not perturb the sensitivity to PfATP4 drug-resistant parasites or alter on-target activity in a PfATP4-associated parasite cytosolic Na+ flux assay and gave a distinct metabolic signature indicative of other PfATP4 inhibitors. The optimized analogs showed an appreciable efficacy in malaria mouse models and blocked sexual stage gamete development preventing transmission to mosquitoes.

Data indicate that postmenopausal women have a higher incidence of mood disorders, and this high vulnerability seems to be related to hormonal changes and weight gain. Although research evaluating the profile of metabolites in mood disorders is advancing, further research, maintaining consistent methodology, is necessary to reach a consensus. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to carry out an exploratory analysis of the plasma polar metabolites and lipids of pre- and postmenopausal women to explore whether the profile is affected by depression. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo (nº 0624/2019) and all participants signed the informed consent. 42 premenopausal and 67 postmenopausal women had the depression symptoms assessed by the Beck Depression's Inventory (BDI). Lipids and polar metabolites were extracted from plasma and analyzed in an ultra-performance liquid chromatography system (UHPLC) coupled to a spectrometer with a triple-quadrupole analyzer operating with an electrospray ionization source (ESI) in positive and negative mode. Lipids and polar metabolites analyses was performed using MetaboAnalyst 5.0. Ten metabolites were significantly affected by depression symptoms in postmenopause, including Adenosine, Guanosine, Proline, Citrulline, Lysine, and Carnitine, which were down-regulated, and Dimethylglycine, Glutathione, Creatine, and Methionine that were up-regulated. In premenopausal women with depression, Oxidized Glutathione was down-regulated, and Dimethylglycine and 4-hydroxyproline were up-regulated. Seven lipids were were significantly affected by depression symptoms in pre-menopausal women PC(36:1)/PC(18:1(9Z)/18:0), PC(19:0/19:0), and LTB4 were up-regulated and PC(18:0/14:0)/GPCho(18:0/14:0), SM(d18:1/16:0), LysoPC(18:1(9z))/LPC 18:1, and Azelaoyl-PAF were down-regulated. In post-menopausal women PC(16:1(9z)/16:1(9z)) and 14,15-DHET were down-regulated and acetylcarnitine was up-regulated. Though there seems to be a relationship in the occurrence of obesity and depression in women the hormonal status influenced the effect of depression in women and that this status may be taken into account when searching for a marker for depression.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001981	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8NQ82			METTL3-mediated chromatin contacts promote stress granule phase separation through metabolic reprogramming during senescence	METTL3 is the catalytic subunit of the methyltransferase complex, which mediates m6A modification to regulate gene expression. In addition, METTL3 regulates transcription in an enzymatic activity-independent manner by driving changes in high-order chromatin structure. However, how these functions of MTC are coordinated remains unknown. Here we show that the methyltransferase complex coordinates its enzymatic activity-dependent and independent functions to regulate cellular senescence, a state of stable cell growth arrest. Specifically, METTL3-mediated chromatin loops induce Hexokinase 2 expression through the three-dimensional chromatin organization during senescence. Elevated Hexokinase 2 expression subsequently promotes liquid-liquid phase separation, manifesting as stress granule phase separation, by driving metabolic reprogramming. This correlates with an impairment of translation of cell-cycle related mRNAs harboring polymethylated m6A sites. In summary, our results report a coordination of m6A-dependent and -independent function of the methyltransferase complex in regulating senescence through phase separation driven by metabolic reprogramming.

It remains unclear how Campylobacter impacts these hosts, though it is becoming increasingly evident that it is a multifactorial process that depends on the host immune response, the gastrointestinal microbiota, various bacterial factors, and host nutritional status. Since these factors likely vary between adult and pediatric patients in different regions of the world, it is important that studies define these attributes in well characterized clinical cohorts in diverse settings. In this study, we analyzed the metabolomic profiles of asymptomatic and symptomatic pediatric patients in Colombia that were either infected or uninfected with Campylobacter during a case-controlled study on acute diarrheal disease. Using computational models, we identified fecal metabolites that were associated with Campylobacter infection and found that glucose-6-phosphate and homovanillic acid were the strongest predictors of infection in these pediatric patients, which suggest that colonocyte metabolism are impacted during infection.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001983	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8D72S			A multimodal drug-diet-immunotherapy combination restrains melanoma progression and metastasis	The genetic landscape of cancer cells can lead to specific metabolic dependencies for tumor growth. Dietary interventions represent an attractive strategy to restrict the availability of key nutrients to tumors. In this study, we identified that growth of a subset of melanoma was severely restricted by a rationally designed combination therapy of a stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) inhibitor with an isocaloric low-oleic acid diet. Despite its importance in oncogenesis, SCD underwent monoallelic co-deletion along with PTEN on chromosome 10q in about 47.5% of melanoma, and the other SCD allele was methylated, resulting in very low SCD expression. While this SCD deficient subset was refractory to SCD inhibitors, the subset of PTEN wildtype melanoma that retained SCD was sensitive. As dietary oleic acid could potentially blunt the effect of SCD inhibitors, a low-oleic acid custom diet was combined with SCD inhibitor. The combination reduced monounsaturated fatty acids and increased saturated fatty acids, inducing robust apoptosis and growth suppression and inhibiting lung metastasis with minimal toxicity in preclinical mouse models of PTEN wildtype melanoma. When combined with anti-PD1 immunotherapy, the SCD inhibitor improved T cell functionality and further constrained melanoma growth in mice. Collectively, these results suggest that optimizing SCD inhibitors with diets low in oleic acid may offer a viable and efficacious therapeutic approach for improving melanoma treatment.

As a medical emergency, early recognition and timely interventions are crucial for improving patient outcomes, particularly in the emergency department setting where septic patients are initially treated. Despite the importance of early identification, current diagnostic tools remain challenges in predicting septic shock at the time of admission. To address these limitations, this study aimed to develop a highly sensitive and specific platform for predicting septic shock in the emergency department using machine learning techniques applied to the metabolic profile. This approach has the potential to optimize the clinical management of septic shock.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001986	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M81142			A clade of receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases and 14-3-3 proteins coordinate the inositol hexaphosphate accumulation	Inositol hexaphosphate (InsP6) is the major storage form of phosphorus in seeds. Reducing seed InsP6 content is a breeding objective in agriculture, as InsP6 negatively impacts animal nutrition and the environment. Nevertheless, how InsP6 accumulation is regulated remains largely unknown. Here, we identify a clade of receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs), named Inositol Polyphosphate-related Cytoplasmic Kinases 1-6 (IPCK1-IPCK6), deeply involved in InsP6 accumulation. The InsP6 concentration is dramatically reduced in seeds of ipck quadruple (T-4m/C-4m) and quintuple (C-5m) mutants, accompanied with the obviously increase of phosphate (Pi) concentration. The plasma membrane-localized IPCKs recruit IPK1 involved in InsP6 synthesis, and facilitate its binding and activity via phosphorylation of GRF 14-3-3 proteins. IPCKs also recruit IPK2s and PI-PLCs required for InsP4/InsP5 and InsP3 biosynthesis respectively, to form a potential IPCK-GRF-PLC-IPK2-IPK1 complex. Our findings therefore uncover a previously uncharacterized regulatory mechanism of InsP6 accumulation governed by IPCKs, shedding new light on the mechanisms of InsP biosynthesis in eukaryotes.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001988	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8RJ07			Rhodoquinone is an Electron Carrier in the Mammalian Electron Transport Chain	Ubiquinone (UQ), the only known electron carrier in the mammalian electron transport chain (ETC), delivers electrons to both oxygen (O2) and fumarate as terminal electron acceptors. As fumarate has a lower reduction potential than UQ, fumarate reduction is only thermodynamically favorable when ubiquinol, the reduced form of UQ, accumulates. Paradoxically, some tissues reduce fumarate without ubiquinol buildup, suggesting another mechanism enables fumarate reduction in mammals. Here, we identify rhodoquinone (RQ), a novel mammalian electron carrier that directs electrons to fumarate, instead of O2, as the favored terminal electron acceptor. RQ, which is undetectable in cultured mammalian cells, is enriched in tissues that catalyze fumarate reduction. RQ and UQ-directed ETC circuits support distinct programs of mitochondrial function. Through expression of a bacterial enzyme that converts UQ into RQ and development a novel RQ analog, we demonstrate that reprogramming the mammalian ETC from the UQ to RQ circuit renders cells highly resistant to hypoxia exposure. Thus, we establish RQ as a fundamental component of the mammalian ETC and unveil reprogramming the ETC to the RQ-circuit as a tractable strategy to treat hypoxia-related diseases.

The five-year survival rate is low, and there is a critical need for new therapeutics. The primary driver in FLC is the fusion oncoprotein, DNAJ-PKAc, which remains challenging to target therapeutically. It is critical, therefore, to expand understanding of the FLC molecular landscape to identify druggable pathways/targets. To date, only one study has attempted to characterize the FLC proteome and metabolome, but with modest sample size (proteomics—n = 16 patient samples; metabolomics—n = 10 patient samples) and protein detection (n = 4620 proteins). We have performed the most comprehensive characterization of FLC in both proteomics (n = 23 patient samples; n = 8485 proteins) and metabolomics (n = 26 patient samples; n = 135 metabolites). Additionally, we have conducted respirometry analyses as well as RNAi- and small molecule inhibitor-mediated loss of function assays in FLC tumors and non-malignant liver tissue from patients. We propose a model of cellular energetics in FLC that centers on amino acids. Our model points to proline anabolism that is very likely mediated by ornithine aminotransferase hyperactivity and ornithine transcarbamylase hypoactivity with serine and glutamine catabolism providing the starting substrate. The metabolic rewiring in FLC proposed by our model, with a particular emphasis on mitochondria, can be exploited for therapeutic vulnerabilities.

Despite the best standard therapies, glioblastoma survivors have a brief survival time, about 24 months on average. The treatment is troublesome because the cancer cells may not respond well to specific therapies as they grow within an extensive network of blood vessels. A multi-omics approach to provide information on biomolecules from multiple layers appears promising for systematically and holistically understanding complex biology. However, till now, only few studies have utilized omics analysis to investigate the impact of anticancer drugs on GBM. Our study aimed to evaluate the impacts of the anticancer medications (paclitaxel 5.3 μg/mL and topotecan 0.26 μM) solely and in pairwise combination on the metabolic and proteomic signatures of the U87 cell line while utilizing the accurate ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) analytical technology. The studied cancer cells wear treated with DMSO (control group), paclitaxel 5.3 µM, topotecan 0.26 µM, and a combination of paclitaxel 5.3 µM and topotecan 0.26 µM. Using One-way ANOVA, we observed 14 significantly altered metabolites compared to those cells treated with DMSO. For combination treatment (paclitaxel and topotecan), 10 metabolites were significantly dysregulated. The sparse partial least squares-discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) showed minimal overlapping, indicating a difference between the four groups. While for proteomics, a total of 79 proteins were significantly dysregulated among the groups. These findings can aid in identifying new biomarkers associated with the utilized drugs and creating a map for targeted therapy. EIF3F, GNB2L1, HINT2, and RPA3 were shown to be significantly upregulated in the combination group when compared to the control. Moreover, ribosome, apoptosis, HIF-1 signaling, arginine and proline, glutathione, purine metabolism, apelin signaling pathway, and glycolysis were significantly altered in the combination group

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001993	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M83T6C			Selective remodeling of the translatome underlies ketogenesis and diet associated tumor growth	Fasting is associated with a range of health benefits, including increased longevity, enhanced brain function, and improved metabolism. How fasting signals elicit changes in the proteome to establish metabolic programs that underlie lipid catabolism and the production of ketone bodies, an essential alternative fuel of energy, remain poorly understood. Here we show that paradoxically, while global translation is downregulated during fasting, hepatocytes selectively remodel the translatome to sustain lipid metabolism and ketogenesis. We discovered that phosphorylation of the major cap binding protein, eukaryotic translation initiation factor (P-eIF4E), is induced during fasting. By employing genome-wide unbiased polysome sequencing, we show that P-eIF4E is responsible for controlling the translation of the entire ketogenesis pathway, including the master regulator of fatty acid oxidation in the liver, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha). Importantly, P-eIF4E regulates those mRNAs through a specific translation regulatory element within their 5’ untranslated regions. Genetic inhibition of P-eIF4E interrupts ketogenesis and fatty acid oxidation upon fasting. In addition, our findings reveal a new signaling property of fatty acids (FAs) derived from adipose tissue lipolysis, which are elevated during fasting. We uncovered that FAs bind and induce AMPK kinase activity that in turn enhances the phosphorylation of the kinase that phosphorylates eIF4E, the mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinase (MNK). The AMPK-MNK axis controls ketogenesis revealing a new lipid-mediated kinase signaling pathway that links ketogenesis to translation control. We further show that genetically inhibiting P-eIF4E also impairs ketogenesis in response to a ketogenic diet. Certain types of cancers, such as pancreatic cancers use ketone bodies as an energy source which may rely on P-eIF4E suggesting a novel point of vulnerability. Our findings reveal that upon a ketogenic diet, treatment with eFT508 (a clinic P-eIF4E inhibitor) restrains pancreatic tumor growth in vivo. Importantly, restoring circulating β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) or overexpression of PPAR-alpha in tumor cells ablate the effect of eFT508, demonstrating a systemic and tumor intrinsic role of P-eIF4E during tumorigenesis in response to a ketogenic diet. Thus, our findings unveil a novel fatty acid-induced signaling pathway that activates selective translation, which underlies the rapid cellular response to fasting and ketogenesis and provides a tailored diet intervention therapy for cancer.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001995	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8VB2V			Molecular signatures of xenograft colon cancer models treated with topotecan: A Mass Spectrometry-Based Study	Prostate cancer poses a significant health risk, ranking as the second most common cancer among men in the United States. However, the effectiveness of current anti-prostate cancer drugs is limited due to increasing drug resistance and side effects. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop new compounds and identify novel drug targets that can surpass these limitations. Due to their targeted mechanism, DNA minor groove binders (MGBs) are becoming more popular as a relatively safe and effective alternative. In our research, we employed multi-omics techniques to investigate the mechanism of action of a novel MGB compound (MGB4) through LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics combined with discovery proteomics analysis performed on LNCaP cells, which were treated with MGB4, doxorubicin, or a combination of both compounds. Through a one-way ANOVA test with a significance level of p-value &lt; 0.05, we identified 99 metabolites and 1143 proteins associated with the treatments. Our findings indicate that treating LNCaP cells with doxorubicin or the MGB4 lead compound yielded similar effects, albeit not identical, on the cells. Both compounds deactivated the translation pathway in the cells. Furthermore, we observed alterations in sphingolipid and amino acid metabolic pathways, potentially contributing to the suppression of prostate cancer cell proliferation and division. Additionally, doxorubicin and combined treatments resulted in reduced metabolism of spermine and spermidine, likely stemming from decreased protein synthesis of key enzymes involved in their pathways. Moreover, the combined treatment exhibited a synergistic interaction between the two compounds, leading to altered purine metabolism and a more pronounced reduction in metabolite abundance compared to individual treatments. Overall, our study demonstrates the robustness of the multi-omics approach in elucidating the mechanism of action of promising drug candidates. It also suggests that MGB4 shows potential as a candidate for prostate cancer treatment.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001996	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8QH90			Integrated multi-omics unveil the impact of the phosphinic compounds, desmethylphosphinothricin and its keto-analogue, on Escherichia coli metabolism	Desmethylphosphinothricin (L-Glu-γ-PH) is the phosphinic analogue of glutamate with a carbon-phosphorus (C-P) bond. In L-Glu-γ-PH the phosphinic group acts as a bioisostere of glutamate γ-carboxyl group allowing the molecule to be a substrate of Escherichia coli glutamate decarboxylase, a pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent α-decarboxylase. In addition, the L-Glu-γ-PH decarboxylation product, GABA-PH, is further metabolized by bacterial GABA-transaminase, another PLP-dependent enzyme, and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenease, a NADP+ -dependent enzyme. The product of these consecutive reactions, the so-called GABA shunt, lead to the formation of succinate-PH, the phosphinic analogue of succinate, a TCA cycle intermediate. Notably, L-Glu-γ-PH displays an antibacterial activity of the same order of well-established antibiotics in E. coli. The dipeptide L-Leu-Glu-γ-PH was shown to display a higher efficacy, likely as a consequence of an improved penetration into the bacteria. Herein, with the aim of further understanding the intracellular effects of L-Glu-γ-PH, 1H NMR-based metabolomics and LC-MS-based shotgun proteomics were used. This study included also the keto-analogue of L-Glu-γ-PH, α-ketoglutarate-γ-PH (α-KG-γ-PH), which also exhibits antimicrobial activity. L-Glu-γ-PH and α-KG-γ-PH were found to similarly impact the bacterial metabolism, though the overall effect of α-KG-γ-PH is more pervasive, and not exclusively because of its intracellular conversion into L-Glu-γ-PH. Notably, both molecules impact the pathways where aspartate, glutamate and glutamine are used as precursors for the biosynthesis of related metabolites, activate the acid stress response and deprive cells of nitrogen. This work highlights the multi-target drug potential of L-Glu-γ-PH and α-KG-γ-PH and paves the way for their exploitation as antimicrobials.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR001998	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8G143			CAR-T therapy metabolomic study	Plasma metabolomics analysis was performed on 44 patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell non Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r/B-NHL) infused with approved CD19.CAR-T cell products at the time of pre-lymphodepletion (PLD) and at day +1, +7, and +30 after CAR-T cell infusion. At the PLD time point, a metabolic profile characterized by high lipoproteins and lactate and low glucose contributed to poor outcome prediction in association with high lactate dehydrogenase levels. At day+1, higher plasma levels of lipid metabolism products and lower glucose and glycoproteins levels were observed in tisa-cel- compared to axi-cel-treated patients. At day+30, a higher content of lactate, as well as phenylalanine/tryptophan amino acids which represent the precursors of the key players of myeloid derived suppressor cells were found in patients who relapsed over time compared to patients who maintained complete remission until 1-year. Our data show complex metabolomic changes that track the evolution of the disease and drug activity in the first 30 days of CAR-T cell therapy. Notably, specific metabolic signatures at PLD and day+30, together with a day+30 metabolic profile related to myeloid immunosuppression, are associated with poor outcome.

However, our understanding on early-life gut microbiome-metabolome maturation trajectories in humans remains limited. This study aims to explore the longitudinal patterns of gut metabolites during early life, and how they are related to gut microbiota composition in birth cohort samples of n = 670 children collected at 2.5 (n=272), 6 (n=232), 14 (n=289), and 30 months (n=157) of age. Factor analysis showed that breastfeeding has an effect on several metabolites including secondary bile acids. We found that the prevalent gut microbial abundances were associated with metabolite levels, especially in the 2.5 months-olds. We also demonstrated that the prevalent early colonizers Bacteroides, Escherichia and Bifidobacterium abundances associated with microbial metabolites bile acids especially in the breastfed infants. Taken together, our results suggests that as the microbiome matures during the early-life there is an association with the metabolome composition in an analogous fashion to how the genome information mature during early life.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002002	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8TR5T			Fetal growth delay caused by loss of non-canonical imprinting is resolved late in pregnancy and culminates in offspring overgrowth	Germline epigenetic programming, including genomic imprinting, substantially influences offspring development. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays an important role in Histone 3 Lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3)-dependent imprinting, loss of which leads to growth and developmental changes in mouse offspring. In this study, we show that offspring from mouse oocytes lacking the PRC2 protein Embryonic Ectoderm Development (EED) were initially developmentally delayed, characterised by low blastocyst cell counts and substantial growth delay in mid-gestation embryos. This initial developmental delay was resolved as offspring underwent accelerated fetal development and growth in late gestation resulting in offspring that were similar stage and weight to controls at birth. The accelerated development and growth in offspring from Eed-null oocytes was associated with remodelling of the placenta, which involved an increase in fetal and maternal tissue size, conspicuous expansion of the glycogen enriched cell population and delayed parturition. Despite placental remodelling and accelerated offspring fetal growth and development, placental efficiency and fetal blood glucose levels were low, and the fetal blood metabolome was unchanged. Moreover, while expression of the H3K27me3-imprinted gene and amino acid transporter Slc38a4 was increased, fetal blood levels of individual amino acids were similar to controls, indicating that placental amino acid transport was not enhanced. Genome-wide analyses identified extensive transcriptional dysregulation and DNA methylation changes in affected placentas, including a range of imprinted and non-imprinted genes. Together, while deletion of Eed in growing oocytes resulted in fetal growth and developmental delay and placental hyperplasia, our data indicate a remarkable capacity for offspring fetal growth to be normalised despite inefficient placental function and the loss of H3K27me3-dependent genomic imprinting.

Beyond acute toxicity, sublethal effects can potentially disrupt honeybee behavior, compromising pollination efficiency. Traditional assessment methods, reliant on visual observations, may not be optimal for capturing sublethal effects. In this study, we delved into molecular mechanisms underlying sublethal effects, employing three distinct platforms: whole-tissue transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and metabolomics. Our findings reveal valuable insights into honeybee toxicity, with certain approaches demonstrating superiority in elucidating tissue-specific and treatment-specific responses, especially untargeted metabolomics tend to be a valuable tool for new bee-friendly agrochemical development. This research will aid in screening new molecules for pollinator safety and contribute to developing strategies that enhance crop yield while maintaining ecological sustainability.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002005	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8FJ9V			Protein restriction slows the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease in mice	Dietary protein is a critical regulator of metabolic health and aging. Low protein diets are associated with healthy aging in humans, and many independent groups of researchers have shown that dietary protein restriction (PR) extends the lifespan and healthspan of mice. Here, we examined the effect of PR on metabolic health and the development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in the 3xTg mouse model of AD. We found that PR has metabolic benefits for 3xTg mice and non-transgenic controls of both sexes, promoting leanness and glycemic control in 3xTg mice and rescuing the glucose intolerance of 3xTg females. We found that PR induces sex-specific alterations in circulating metabolites and in the brain lipidome, downregulating sphingolipid subclasses including ceramides, glucosylceramides, and sphingomyelins in 3xTg females. Consumption of a PR diet starting at 6 months of age reduced AD pathology in conjunction with reduced mTORC1 activity, increased autophagy, and had cognitive benefits for 3xTg mice. Finally, PR improved the survival of 3xTg mice. Our results demonstrate that PR slows the progression of AD at molecular and pathological levels, preserves cognition in this mouse model of AD, and suggests that PR or pharmaceutical interventions that mimic the effects of this diet may hold promise as a treatment for AD.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002009	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8XJ96			NMR-based lipidomics in Breast Cancer	Recurrent and metastatic breast cancer is frequently treatment resistant. A wealth of evidence suggests that reprogrammed lipid metabolism supports cancer recurrence. Overexpression of the RON and DEK proteins in breast cancer is associated with poor outcome. Both proteins promote cancer metastasis in laboratory models, but effects on lipid metabolite levels remain unknown. To measure RON- and DEK-dependent steady-state lipid metabolite levels, an Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)-based approach was utilized. The observed differences were then used to identify a lipid metabolism-related gene expression signature that is prognostic of overall survival (OS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), post-progression survival (PPS), and recurrence free survival (RFS) in patients with breast cancer. RON loss led to decreased cholesterol and sphingomyelin levels, while DEK loss increased total fatty acid levels and decreased free glycerol levels. Lipid-related genes were then queried to define a signature that predicts breast, ovarian, and lung cancer patient survival. Taken together, RON and DEK differentially regulate lipid metabolism in a manner that predicts and may promote breast cancer metastasis and recurrence.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002011	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8P23X			Lipidomic analysis of Axon Regeneration in Xenopus laevis Chiasm	CNS injuries of the anuran amphibian, Xenopus laevis, are uniquely befitted for studying the molecular compositions of neuronal regeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) due to a functional recovery of optic axons disparate to adult mammalian analogues. RGCs and their optic nerve axons undergo irreversible neurodegeneration in glaucoma and associated optic neuropathies, resulting in blindness in mammals. Conversely, Xenopus demonstrates RGC lifetime-spanning regenerative capabilities after optic nerve crush, inciting opportunities to compare de novo regeneration and develop efficient pharmaceutical approaches for vision restoration. Studies revealing lipidome alterations during optic nerve regeneration are sparse and could serve as a solid foundation for these underlying molecular changes. We profile the lipid changes in a transgenic line of 1 year old Xenopus laevis Tg(islet2b:gfp) frogs that were either had a monocular surgery of either a left optic crush injury (crush) or sham surgery (sham). The matching controls of uninjured right optic nerves were also collected (control). Tg(islet2b:gfp) frogs were allowed to recover for 12 and 27 days post optic nerve crush. Following euthanasia, the optic nerves were collected for lipidomic analysis. A modified Bligh and Dyer method was used for lipid extraction, followed by untargeted mass spectrometry lipid profiling with a Q-Exactive Orbitrap Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (LC MS-MS) coupled with Vanquish Horizon Binary UHPLC LC-MS system.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002013	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8DJ7S			Glutathione synthesis in the mouse liver supports lipid abundance through NRF2 repression.	Cells rely on antioxidants to survive. The most abundant antioxidant is glutathione (GSH). The synthesis of GSH is non-redundantly controlled by the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC). GSH imbalance is implicated in many diseases, but the requirement for GSH in adult tissues is unclear. To interrogate this, we have developed a series of in vivo models to induce Gclc deletion in adult animals. We find that GSH is essential to lipid abundance in vivo. GSH levels are highest in liver tissue, which is also a hub for lipid production. While the loss of GSH does not cause liver failure, it decreases lipogenic enzyme expression, circulating triglyceride levels, and fat stores. Mechanistically, we find that GSH promotes lipid abundance by repressing NRF2, a transcription factor induced by oxidative stress. These studies identify GSH as a fulcrum in the liver's balance of redox buffering and triglyceride production.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002014	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M88R67			Suppression of prostaglandin I2–type I interferon axis induces extramedullary hematopoiesis to promote cardiac repair after myocardial infarction	Background: Immune cells are closely associated with all processes of cardiac repair following myocardial infarction (MI), including the initiation, development, and resolution of inflammation. Spleen extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) serves as a critical source of emergency mature blood cells that are generated through the self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). However, how EMH responds to MI and the role of EMH in cardiac repair post-MI remains unclear. Methods: To assess the role of spleen EMH in MI, a Tcf21CreERScfflox/flox MI mouse model with inhibited EMH was constructed. GFP+ HSCs sorted from eGFP mouse spleen by flow cytometry and injected into Tcf21CreERScfflox/flox mice to test the sources of local inflammatory cells during MI. Using highly specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and single-cell RNA sequencing, we analyzed the lipidomic profile of arachidonic acid metabolites and the transcriptomes of HSPCs in the spleen after MI. Results: We found that MI enhanced EMH, as reflected by the increase in spleen weight and volume and the number of HSPCs in the spleen. The lack of EMH in Scf-deficient mice exacerbated tissue injury post-MI. Analyzing the transcriptome of spleen HSPCs post-MI, we found the type I interferon (IFN) pathway significantly inhibited in HSC/multipotent progenitor subclusters and the absence of type I IFN signaling enhanced the MI-induced spleen EMH. Lipidomics analysis revealed that prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) was markedly reduced in the spleen. Mechanistically, PGI2 suppressed MI-induced EMH through a PGI2 receptor (IP)-cAMP-453p-SP1 cascade in spleen HSPCs. Finally, hematopoietic cell-specific IP-deficient mice exhibited enhanced EMH and improved cardiac recovery post-MI, which mitigated the adverse secondary outcomes of treatment with cicaprost, a PGI2 analog and anti-inflammatory agent. Conclusions: Together, our findings revealed that a PGI2–IFN axis was involved in spleen EMH after MI, providing new mechanistic insights into spleen EMH post-MI and offering a new therapeutic target for treating ischemic cardiac injury.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002015	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85238			Zeb1-mediated control of the phospholipid PUFA/MUFA ratio in EMT/plasticity-associated 1 cancer cell ferroptosis	Therapy resistance and metastasis, the most fatal steps in cancer, are often triggered by a (partial) activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT)-program. A mesenchymal phenotype predisposes to ferroptosis, a cell death pathway exerted by an iron and oxygen-radical mediated peroxidation of phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). We here describe that various forms of EMT-activation increase ferroptosis-susceptibility in cancer cells, which depends on the EMT-transcription factor Zeb1. To further investigate the underlying mechanisms of an EMT/Zeb1-coupled ferroptosis sensitivity, we analyzed key determinants of ferroptotic cell death, focusing on the proportion and (per)oxidation of fatty acid species in phospholipid subclasses. Using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), we demonstrate that GPX4 inhibition in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells (Zeb1high) led to a rapid (per)oxidation of PUFA-containing phospholipids (oxPL), which is absent in cells depleted of Zeb1 (shZeb1). Mechanistically, Zeb1 increases the ratio of phospholipids containing pro-ferroptotic PUFAs over cyto-protective monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) in MDA-MB-231 cells, tumor-derived pancreatic cancer KPC cells as well as mice tumor allografts via the modulation of crucial lipogenic enzymes.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002016	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M81C00			Effects of mitoregulin loss on cardiac and mitochondrial lipids in mice	We and others discovered a highly-conserved mitochondrial transmembrane microprotein, named Mitoregulin (Mtln), that supports lipid metabolism. We reported that Mtln strongly binds cardiolipin (CL), increases mitochondrial respiration and Ca2+ retention capacities, and reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here we extend our observation of Mtln-CL binding and examine Mtln influence on cristae structure and mitochondrial membrane integrity during stress. We demonstrate that mitochondria from constitutive- and inducible Mtln-knockout (KO) mice are susceptible to membrane freeze-damage and that this can be rescued by acute Mtln re-expression. In mitochondrial-simulated lipid monolayers, we show that synthetic Mtln decreases lipid packing and monolayer elasticity. Lipidomics revealed that Mtln-KO heart tissues show broad decreases in 22:6-containing lipids and increased cardiolipin damage/remodeling. Lastly, we demonstrate that Mtln-KO mice suffer worse myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, hinting at a translationally-relevant role for Mtln in cardioprotection. Our work supports a model in which Mtln binds cardiolipin and stabilizes mitochondrial membranes to broadly influence diverse mitochondrial functions, including lipid metabolism, while also protecting against stress.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002017	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8WJ8H			Mitochondrial respiration in microglia is essential for response to demyelinating injury but not proliferation.	Microglia are necessary for CNS function during development and play roles in aging, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and the response to demyelinating injury. Mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) controls macrophage-dependent immune responses. However, whether mitochondrial RC is essential to microglia function is not known. We conditionally deleted the mitochondrial complex III subunit Rieske Iron-Sulfur Protein (RISP) in the microglia of adult mice to assess the requirement of microglial RC for survival, proliferation, and adult CNS function in vivo. Surprisingly, mitochondrial RC function was not required for survival or proliferation of microglia in vivo. RNA-seq analysis showed that loss of RC function in microglia caused changes in gene expression distinct from aged or disease-associated microglia (DAM). Microglia-specific loss of mitochondrial RC function did not affect cognitive decline during aging or in the 5xFAD model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, Abeta plaque coverage decreased and microglial interaction with Abeta plaques increased in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice with mitochondrial RC-deficient microglia. Microglia-specific loss of mitochondrial RC function did impair remyelination following an acute, reversible demyelinating event. Thus, mitochondrial respiration in microglia is dispensable for maintenance of normal cognitive function but is essential to maintain a proper response to CNS demyelinating injury.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002018	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8RV57			Temperature change elicits lipidome adaptation in the simple organisms Mycoplasma mycoides and JCVI-syn3B	Cell membranes mediate interactions between life and its environment, with lipids determining their properties. Understanding how cells adjust their lipidomes to tune membrane properties is crucial yet poorly defined due to the complexity of most organisms. We used quantitative shotgun lipidomics to study temperature adaptation in the simple organism Mycoplasma mycoides and the minimal cell, JCVI-syn3B. We show that lipid abundances follow a universal logarithmic distribution across eukaryotes and bacteria, with comparable degrees of lipid remodeling for adaptation regardless of lipidomic or organismal complexity. Lipid features analysis demonstrates head group-specific acyl chain remodeling as characteristic of lipidome adaptation; its deficiency in Syn3B is associated with impaired homeoviscous adaptation. Temporal analysis reveals a two-stage cold adaptation process: swift cholesterol and cardiolipin shifts followed by gradual acyl chain modifications. This work provides an in-depth analysis of lipidome adaptation in minimal cells, laying a foundation to probe the design principles of living membranes.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002019	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8N23M			4-diet multi-organ and multi-omic crosstalk	Presently, dietary patterns have undergone significant shifts, and understanding the intricate interplay between diet, particularly high fat and high sucrose diets, the gut microbiome, and cardiometabolic health has become paramount. These dietary patterns have been consistently associated with heightened cardiometabolic risk factors including obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. High-fat diets, in particular, contribute to increased adiposity and ectopic fat deposition, exacerbating systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby promoting the development of metabolic dysfunction. Similarly, high sucrose diets have been implicated in the dysregulation of glucose homeostasis, leading to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, key hallmarks of cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Amidst this, the exploration of multi-omic profiles alongside the gut microbial landscape has emerged as a pivotal avenue for unraveling the complexities of cardiometabolic health dynamics affected by the effects of high-fat and high-sucrose diets. The approach of using a multi-omic comparison between organs offers a comprehensive lens through which the intricate molecular signatures underlying the impact of dietary compositions, particularly high fat and high sucrose, on metabolic health, can be examined.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002020	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8HC1Q			Analysis of Pasture-Fed vs Grain-Fed Meat in North American Ruminants	The goal of this work was to compare meat metabolomes (pectoralis profundus) of Black Angus cattle from two commercial US beef finishing systems (pasture-finished on Western U.S. rangeland; n=18 and grain-finished in a Midwest U.S. feedlot; n=18). All analyzed samples (pasture-finished and grain-finished) were from cattle harvested in September-October of 2020 and had a Black Angus genetic background. The pasture-finished animals were between 25-27 months of age, while the grain-finished animals ranged from 18-22 months of age at time of slaughter. All cattle were processed in USDA-inspected slaughter facilities and the researchers worked with the producers to collect meat samples (Pectoralis profundus) from 18 individual animals (n=18) per group. Metabolomics analysis was performed by Metabolon (Morrisville, NC). Statistical analyses were performed in ArrayStudio/Jupyter Notebook, MetaboAnalyst, and R.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002023	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8423Z			Iron(III)-salophene catalyzes redox cycles that induce phospholipid peroxidation and deplete cancer cells of ferroptosis-protecting cofactors	Ferroptosis, regulated by glutathione peroxidase 4 and redox cycles, offers new cancer treatment strategies. Chlorido[N,N’-disalicylidene-1,2-phenylenediamine]iron(III) complexes (SCs, compounds 1-3) exhibit potent anti-cancer effects by inducing ferroptosis, apoptosis, or necroptosis, including in therapy-resistant cancers. Our study shows that SCs favor ferroptosis in triple-negative breast cancer cells and are effective against invasive, chemo- or radioresistant cell lines. Redox lipidomics indicates that SCs initiate cell death through extensive oxidation of arachidonic and adrenic acids in membrane phospholipids. Mechanistically, SCs catalyze one-electron transfer reactions, reducing Fe(III) to Fe(II), forming oxo-bridged dimers, and generating organic radicals using hydrogen peroxide. This process depletes NADPH, oxidizes membrane phospholipids, and disrupts cellular detoxification of phospholipid hydroperoxides.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002024	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M80C0P			A Covalent Creatine Kinase Inhibitor Ablates Glioblastoma Migration and Sensitizes Tumors to Oxidative Stress	Glioblastoma is a Grade 4 primary brain tumor defined by therapy resistance, diffuse infiltration, and near-uniform lethality. The underlying mechanisms are unknown, and no treatment has been curative. Using a recently developed kinase inhibitor (CKi), we explored the role of this inhibitor on GBM biology in vitro. While CKi minimally impacted GBM cell proliferation and viability, it significantly affected migration. In established GBM cell lines and patient-derived xenografts, CKi ablated both the migration and invasion of GBM cells. CKi also hindered radiation-induced migration. RNA-seq revealed a decrease in invasion-related genes, with an unexpected increase in glutathione metabolism and ferroptosis protection genes post-CKi treatment. The effects of CKi could be reversed by the addition of cell-permeable glutathione. Carbon-13 metabolite tracing indicated heightened glutathione biosynthesis post-CKi treatment. Combinatorial CKi blockade and glutathione inhibition or ferroptosis activation abrogated cell survival. Our data demonstrated that CKi perturbs promigratory and anti-ferroptotic roles in GBM, identifying the creatine kinase axis as a druggable target for GBM treatment.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002026	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8QV5X			SLC25A48 controls mitochondrial choline import and metabolism	Choline is an essential nutrient for cellular metabolism, including the biosynthesis of phospholipids, neurotransmitters, and one-carbon metabolism. A critical step in choline catabolism is the mitochondrial import and synthesis of choline-derived methyl donors, such as betaine. However, the underlying mechanisms and the biological significance of mitochondrial choline metabolism remain poorly understood. Here, we report that a previously uncharacterized mitochondrial inner-membrane protein, SLC25A48, controls mitochondrial choline transport and catabolism in vivo. We show that SLC25A48 is highly expressed in brown adipose tissue and is required for whole-body cold tolerance, thermogenesis, mitochondrial respiration, and mitochondrial membrane integrity. Choline uptake into the mitochondria via SLC25A48 facilitates the synthesis of betaine and purine nucleotides, whereas loss of SLC25A48 resulted in increased production of reactive oxygen species and imbalanced mitochondrial lipids. Notably, human cells carrying a single nucleotide polymorphism on the SLC25A48 gene and cancer cells lacking SLC25A48 exhibited elevated oxidative stress and impaired cell proliferation. Together, the present study identified SLC25A48 as a mitochondrial carrier that mediates choline catabolism and plays a critical role in mitochondrial function and cell survival.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002027	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8M24P			Malic Enzyme 2 maintains metabolic state and anti-tumor immunity of CD8+ T cells	The functional integrity of CD8+ T cells is closely linked to metabolic reprogramming, therefore, understanding of the metabolic basis of CD8+ T cell activation and antitumor immunity could provide insights into tumor immunotherapy. Here, we report that ME2 is critical for CD8+ T cell activation and immune response against malignancy. ME2 deficiency suppresses CD8+ T cells activation and anti-tumor immune response in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ME2 depletion blocks the TCA cycle flux, leading to the accumulation of fumarate. Fumarate directly binds to DAPK1 and inhibits its activity by competing with ATP for binding. Notably, ME2 deficiency increases the ratio of fumarate to ATP, thereby leading to the inhibition of DAPK1. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of DAPK1 abolishes the anti-tumor function conferred by ME2 to CD8+ T cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a role for ME2 in the regulation of CD8+ T cell metabolism and effector functions, as well as an unexpected function for fumarate as a metabolic signal in the inhibition of DAPK1.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002028	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8GC01			Metabolomics analysis of human spermatozoa reveals impaired metabolic pathways in asthenozoospermia	Background: Infertility is a major health issue, affecting 15% of reproductive-age couples with male factors contributing to 50% of cases. Asthenozoospermia, or low sperm motility, is a common cause of male infertility with complex etiology, involving genetic and metabolic alterations, inflammation, and oxidative stress. However, the molecular mechanisms behind low motility are unclear. In this study, we used a metabolomics approach to identify metabolic biomarkers and pathways involved in sperm motility. Methods: We compared the metabolome and lipidome of spermatozoa of men with normozoospermia (n = 44) and asthenozoospermia (n = 22) using untargeted LC-MS and the metabolome of seminal fluid using 1H-NMR. Additionally, we evaluated the seminal fluid redox status to assess the oxidative stress in the ejaculate. Results: We identified 112 metabolites and 209 lipids in spermatozoa and 27 metabolites in the seminal fluid of normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic men. PCA analysis of the spermatozoa’s metabolomics and lipidomics data showed a clear separation between groups. Spermatozoa of asthenozoospermic men presented lower levels of several amino acids, and increased levels of energetic substrates and lysophospholipids. However, the metabolome and redox status of the seminal fluid was not altered in asthenozoospermia. Conclusions: Our results indicate impaired metabolic pathways associated with redox homeostasis and amino acid, energy, and lipid metabolism in asthenozoospermia. Taken together, these findings suggest that the metabolome and lipidome of human spermatozoa are key factors influencing their motility and that oxidative stress exposure during spermatogenesis or sperm maturation may be in the etiology of decreased motility in asthenozoospermia.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002029	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8BJ9X			FDX2-KO induces global down-regulation of iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins and senescence-like growth arrest or death in ovarian cancer cells	Recent studies report molecular mechanisms underlying iron-sulfur cluster (Fe-S) biosynthesis and suggest its importance in health and disease. However, a role for Fe-S biosynthesis in cancer contexts remains unclear. Here we report that FDX2, an Fe-S assembly factor, is indispensable for maintenance of cellular Fe-S-containing proteins (Fe-S protein(s)) and proliferation of ovarian cancer (OVC) cells. CRISPR-screening of all metabolism-related genes in OVC cells identified several Fe-S assembly genes as essential for OVC growth. Using an inducible FDX2-KO OVC line, we found that FDX2 loss promotes either senescence-like growth arrest or cell death, depending on TP53 status. Mechanistically, FDX2-loss caused global but differential post transcriptional down-regulation of Fe-S proteins, in turn perturbing respiration, iron-regulation and redox homeostasis, all associated with DNA damage. These results demonstrate significant roles for Fe-S biosynthesis in OVC proliferation and survival and provide information about how the cellular Fe-S-protein network responds to disruptions in Fe-S assembly.

Metabolites were extracted using a Precellys Homogenizer and a serial extraction method: (1) 1:1 Methanol/Water and (2) 8:1:1 Acetonitrile/Methanol/Acetone. Metabolites were analyzed by untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC MS-MS) profiling using a Q-Exactive Orbitrap instrument coupled with Vanquish Horizon Binary UHPLC LC-MS system. Metabolites were identified and quantified using Compound Discoverer 3.3 and isotopic internal metabolites standards.

Unfortunately, the echinocandin drugs that are fungicidal against other important fungal pathogens are ineffective against Cryptococcus neoformans, the causative agent of life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised people. Contributing mechanisms for echinocandin tolerance are emerging with connections to calcineurin signaling, the cell wall, and membrane composition. In this context, we discovered that a defect in phosphate uptake impairs the tolerance of C. neoformans to the echinocandin caspofungin.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002038	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85V5Z			Interaction between NSCLC cells, CD8+ T cells and immune checkpoint inhibitors potentiates coagulation and promotes metabolic remodeling- new cues on CAT-VTE	Abstract Cancer-related thrombosis (CAT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are common cancer-related sequelae linked with high mortality, therefore finding predictive indicators is critical. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are utilized in cancer immunotherapy to activate T lymphocytes against cancer cells. Recent retrospective investigations found that some individuals experienced increased VTE after receiving ICI. We postulated that ICI (anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1) effect on immunological and cancer cells, as well as their interaction, contributes for an elevated risk of CAT-VTE. Our objective is to investigate this molecular interaction in order to uncover potential prothrombotic indicators. We pharmacologically modulated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines in co-culture with CD8+ T lymphocytes (T CD8+) obtained from healthy blood donors. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) metabolic remodeling analysis revealed differences in extracellular metabolite concentrations after T CD8+ and ICI treatment.

Despite progress in therapeutic interventions, encompassing surgical procedures, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapies and immunotherapy, the overall prognosis remains unfavorable. Imbalances in redox equilibrium and disrupted redox signaling, common traits in tumors, play crucial roles in malignant progression and treatment resistance. Cancer cells, often characterized by persistent high levels of ROS resulting from genetic, metabolic, and microenvironmental alterations, counterbalance this by enhancing their antioxidant capacity. Cysteine availability emerges as a critical factor in chemoresistance, shaping the survival dynamics of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Selenium-chrysin (SeChry) was disclosed as a modulator of cysteine intracellular availability. This study comprehensively characterizes the metabolism of SeChry in NSCLC. SeChry treatment induces notable metabolic shifts, particularly in selenocompounds metabolism, impacting crucial pathways such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and amino acid metabolism. Additionally, SeChry affects the levels of key metabolites such as acetate, lactate, glucose, and amino acids, contributing to disruptions in redox homeostasis and cellular biosynthesis.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002040	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8XB94			Quantification of amoxicillin in intestinal contents of mice	Antibiotics cause collateral damage to resident microbes that is associated with various health risks. To-date, studies have largely focused on impacts of antibiotics on large intestinal and fecal microbiota. Here, we employ a GI-wide integrated multiomic approach to reveal that amoxicillin (AMX) treatment reduces overall bacterial abundance, bile salt hydrolase activity and unconjugated bile acids in the small intestine (SI). An accompanying loss of fatty acids and increase in acyl-carnitines in the large intestine corresponded with spatially-distinct expansions of proteobacteria. Parasuterella excrementihominis utilized fatty acid biosynthesis, becoming dominant in the SI while multiple Klebsiella species employed fatty acid oxidation during expansion in the large intestine. We subsequently demonstrate that restoration of unconjugated bile acids can mitigate losses of commensals in the large intestine while also inhibiting the expansion of Proteobacteria during AMX treatment.

Limited knowledge of metabolic alterations during malting hinders the ability to enhance malt quality. This study uses untargeted GC-MS and LC-MS metabolite profiling to characterize metabolic dynamics through the malting process. After data processing, a total of 4980 known metabolites were identified across six stages: dry seed, post-steeping, germination (DOG1, DOG3, DOG5), and kilned, about 82% of these showed significant changes during malting. Statistical analysis revealed stage-dependent shifts in metabolite profiles, highlighting the importance of the first 3 days of germination and kilning in determining the final metabolite content of finished malt. Dynamic changes in chemical classes and metabolic pathways provided insights into processes critical for malt quality and beer production. Additionally, metabolites associated with antimicrobial properties and stress responses were identified, underscoring the interplay between barley and microbial metabolic processes during malting. This comprehensive profiling advances our understanding of malting and suggests potential markers for process monitoring and quality control, ultimately enhancing malt quality and beer production.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002042	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8NV6P			High expression of oleoyl-ACP-hydrolase underpins life-threatening respiratory viral diseases	Although respiratory viral infections cause significant morbidity and mortality, it is unclear why some individuals succumb to severe disease. In patients hospitalized with avian A(H7N9) influenza, we investigated early drivers underpinning hypercytokinemia and fatal disease. Our transcriptomics studies identified differential expression of 10 early host genes, defined by 16 probe sets, between patients who recovered and died. Seven probe sets were specific for the same host gene encoding for a key enzyme mediating free fatty acid production, oleoyl-ACP-hydrolase (OLAH). High OLAH levels in fatal A(H7N9) patients were detected early after hospital admission and persisted until patients died. Conversely, patients who recovered had minimal OLAH expression throughout their hospital stay. High OLAH levels were also detected in patients hospitalized for severe infections with seasonal influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), while the main catalytic product of OLAH, oleic acid, was increased in hospitalized compared to ambulatory patients. Among healthy individuals and those with mild infections, however, OLAH was minimally detected. To understand how OLAH drives disease severity, we generated olah deficient mice. In contrast to wild-type mice, lethal influenza infection of olah-/- mice led to survival, milder disease, and markedly reduced lung viral loads, tissue damage, infection-driven pulmonary innate cell infiltration and inflammatory milieu. This phenotype was associated with differential lipid droplet dynamics, and reduced viral infection and inflammatory responses in macrophages. Supplementation of oleic acid, the main product of OLAH, increased influenza infection of macrophages and their inflammatory potential. Increased infectivity in the presence of olah was dependent on lipid droplet usage. Our findings define how expression of the key host enzyme, OLAH, drives life-threatening inflammation associated with respiratory viruses and propose OLAH as a potential early target for diagnosis and treatment of patients with severe disease.

Frequent injury due to environmental challenges requires constant restoration of the skin barrier. Specific defects in ceramide lipid metabolism have been associated with inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD). The goal of this study was to characterize the lipid landscape and biosynthetic pathways activated during epidermal repair using MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). A keratinocyte culture model of wound healing confirmed that glycerophospholipids and glycosphingolipids are impacted during cell proliferation and that sialic acid supplementation can decrease wound closure time. In skin biopsies of healing tissue taken from healthy volunteers, specific phospholipids were upregulated, including phosphatidylcholine and sphingolipids, which play critical roles in membrane repair and cell signaling. Comparing controls to patients with AD, we again identified defects in ceramide-related lipid metabolism with specific defects in lysophosphatidylcholine (Lyso PC) 18:1. Topical application of LysoPC 18:1 provided modest clinical improvement in a mouse model of AD. We then applied this workflow to samples taken from patients with eczematous phenotypes due to STAT3 dominant negative hyper IgE syndrome and identified metabolic disruption of thiamine and phosphatidylinositol metabolism. Overall, the results indicate MALDI imaging can be used to characterize changes in lipid metabolism during wound healing and may indicate an underappreciated role of LysoPC 18:1 during tissue repair.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002045	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M88N7K			High Fat Feeding Alters Circulating Triglyceride Profile by Decreasing SCD Activity and Depleting omega-3 Fatty Acids	The study was to examine, in control and high-fat-fed rats, the effects of acute feeding (a single meal) on circulating lipid profiles. Acute feeding is expected to impact circulating lipid profiles due to lipids in chylomicron derived from the diet, and the acute feeding response may be altered with a HFD to account for some of the chronic effects of a HFD. The study was to examine the effects of a high fat diet (HFD) on circulating TG profiles in rats and test the hypothesis that a HFD reduces TGs composed of long-chain PUFAs, as previously seen in rats maintained on a HNaLK diet. Thus, we performed lipidomics analysis on plasma samples collected both in the pre- and postprandial states in the control and HFD groups. Lipidomics analysis was combined with general metabolomics analysis, which provides measurements of saturated FFAs and other metabolic indicators such as glycerol (as lipolysis indicator) or 3-hydroxybutyrate (ketosis indicator), not measured in our LC-MS-based lipidomics assay. The results provided novel insights into the differential behaviors of individual TGs and identified specific changes (i.e., decreased stearoyl-CoA desaturase [SCD] activity and depletion of omega-3 FFAs) associated with short-term high-fat feeding.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002050	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8MZ4N			Hypothalamic SLC7A14 accounts for aging-reduced lipolysis in white adipose tissue	The central nervous system has been implicated in the age-induced reduction in adipose tissue lipolysis. SLC7A14 is a lysosomal membrane protein highly expressed in the brain. Herein, we investigated the possible role of hypothalamic SLC7A14 in the age-induced lipolysis reduction. In this study, we demonstrated the expression of SLC7A14 was reduced in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons of aged mice. Overexpression of SLC7A14 in POMC neurons alleviated the age-induced reduction in white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis, whereas SLC7A14 deletion mimicked the age-induced lipolysis impairment. Moreover, POMC SLC7A14 regulated WAT lipolysis independently of sympathetic nerves in WAT. Metabolomics analysis revealed that POMC SLC7A14 increased the primary bile acid taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) content, which mediated the SLC7A14 knockout- or age-induced WAT lipolysis impairment. Furthermore, SLC7A14-increased TCDCA content is dependent on intestinal apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), which is regulated by intestinal sympathetic afferent nerves. Finally, SLC7A14 regulated the intestinal sympathetic afferent nerves by inhibiting mTORC1 signaling through inhibiting TSC1 phosphorylation. Collectively, our study suggests the function for central SLC7A14 and an upstream mechanism for the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Moreover, our data provides insights into the brain–gut–adipose tissue crosstalk in age-induced lipolysis impairment.

We target the rat dorsal and ventral striatum, given its importance in motivation, movement, and reward processing and identify 489 compounds. Despite the depth of analysis, many well-known neurochemicals, such as all neurotransmitters, were not identified in the untargeted method. These compounds could be detected using BzCl derivation in a targeted method though. By tracking isotopic BzCl feature pair detection and filtering of MS/MS spectra by known benzoyl fragment ions, we found 872 unique features in dialysate suggesting many unknown compounds remain to be identified in dialysate.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002053	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M87N78			Metabolic Alterations in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage	Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a severe type of stroke that is associated with poor outcome. A subset of patients with aSAH will develop secondary complications, most notably delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), which potentiates neurological injury. In this study, we investigate the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) iron accumulation, brain metabolism, and neuronal injury in aSAH patients with or without DCI. We collected longitudinal CSF samples of patients immediately after hospitalization and 5-8 days after onset of ictus. CSF was analyzed with metabolomics to determine metabolic alterations associated with aSAH and DCI. Metabolomic profiling of the CSF samples uncovered significant dysregulation of metabolic pathways associated with energy generation and amino acid utilization, consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction. Using machine learning, we identified a set of metabolites that predicted ICU length of stay (LOS). aSAH alters the CSF metabolome involved in mitochondrial function and a subset of these metabolites are predictive of ICU stay. These results identify potential biomarkers for mitochondrial pathology and provide insight into alterations in brain iron metabolism triggered by aSAH.

We and others have reported a central role for the actin-bundling protein (fascin) in regulating breast cancer disease progression at different levels. However, whether fascin expression promotes metabolic molecules that could predict disease progression has not been fully elucidated. Here, fascin expression was manipulated via knockdown (fascinKD+NORF) and rescue (fascinKD+FORF) in the naturally fascin-positive (fascinpos+NORF) MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Whether fascin dysregulates metabolic profiles that are associated with disease progression was assessed using untargeted metabolomics analyses via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. An overall of 12,226 metabolites were detected in the tested cell pellets. Fascinpos+NORF cell pellets showed 2,510 and 3,804 significantly dysregulated metabolites compared to their fascinKD+NORF counterparts. Fascin rescue (fascinKD+FORF) revealed 2,710 significantly dysregulated cellular metabolites compared to fascinKD+NORF counterparts. 101 overlapped cellular metabolites between fascinKD+FORF and fascinpos+NORF were significantly dysregulated in the fascinKD+NORF cells. Analysis of the significantly dysregulated metabolites by fascin expression revealed their involvement in the metabolism of sphingolipid, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, which are critical pathways for breast cancer progression. Our findings of fascin-mediated alteration of metabolic pathways could be used as putative poor prognostic biomarkers and highlight other underlying mechanisms of fascin contribution to breast cancer progression.

Each treatment is set with 6 replicates for assessing nontargeted metabolomics. The LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using a Thermo UHPLC-Q Exactive HF-X system equipped with an ACQUITY HSS T3 column. As a result, a total of 296 and 569 metabolites were identified in negative ion mode and positive mode, respectively.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002058	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8KZ5Q			An untargeted metabolic profiling strategy for the dissection of the oat (Avena sativa L.) plant innate immune response to various Pseudomonas syringae pathovars	One of the most important characteristics that plants utilise to successfully defend themselves is the ability to rapidly identify potential threats in the surrounding environment. Plants rely on the perception of microbe-derived molecular pattern chemicals for this recognition, which initiates a number of induced defence reactions that ultimately increase plant resistance. The metabolome acts as a metabolic fingerprint of the biochemical activities that take place in a biological system under particular conditions and therefore provides a functional readout of the cellular mechanisms involved in a biological system. In this study, an untargeted metabolomics approach was applied to decipher the biochemical processes involved in oat plant defence responses to inoculation with various pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae (pathogenic and non-pathogenic on oat) such as P. syringae pv. coronafaciens (Ps-c), -pv. tabaci (Ps-t), -pv. tomato DC3000 (DC3000) and -pv. tomato DC3000 hrcC mutant (hrcC−) and thereby identify signatory markers that are involved in host or nonhost defence responses. At the seedling growth stage, metabolic alterations in the Dunnart oat cultivar (tolerant to Ps-c) in response to inoculation with the respective Pseudomonas syringae pathovars were examined. Following inoculation, plants were monitored for symptom development and harvested at 2-, 4- and 6 d.p.i.. Methanolic metabolite extracts were prepared, and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) connected to a qTOF high-definition mass spectrometer was used to analyse the extracts. Chemometric modelling and multivariate statistical analysis revealed host- and time-related metabolic alterations that point to host and nonhost interactions in response to bacterial inoculation/infection. Metabolic profiles from further multivariate data analyses revealed a range of metabolite classes involved in the respective defence responses, including phenolic amides, saponins, phenolic acids, flavonoids, fatty acids, amino acids and alkaloids. The findings in this study allowed the elucidation of metabolic changes involved in oat defence responses to a range of pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae and ultimately contributed to a more comprehensive view of the oat plant metabolism under biotic stress during host vs nonhost interactions.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002060	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8BG0T			Integrative analysis of serum and fecal metabolome and the microbiome that herald Crohn Disease flare, serum samples	We investigated the relationship between the host and gut microbiota in the context of Crohn Disease (CD), which is a relapsing-remitting condition. We analyzed paired omics of 80 CD patients and 43 controls, including 202 serum and 294 fecal metabolomics, and 258 microbiome samples. Our findings suggest that CD patients have an inverse shift in energy utilization from sugars and fat between serum and feces. In the serum, we noted a decrease in metabolites related to starch, sucrose, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as well as an increase in metabolites linked to fat in contrast to the feces, where we noted higher sugars and TCA cycle metabolites, and lower fat metabolites. Interestingly, fecal sugars were specifically linked with oral bacteria mislocated to the CD gut, while unsaturated fat derivatives of arachidonic acid were linked with R. gnavus and Fusobacteria. We identified consistent metabolite alterations in CD patients, which were also present in clinical/biomarkers active CD, and pre-flare samples of patients who experienced flare. Using pre-flare samples, we developed models that predicted a subsequent flare using metabolic serum and fecal signatures. We validated the fecal metabolomics predictions in another, similarly designed, independent CD cohort. Finally, we developed a clinical lab-based index [UA/Cr ratio+log2(CRP)] based on the serum metabolomics model, which was also predictive in the validation cohort. Here are the serum metabolomics samples.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002062	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M82Z4P			Randomized phase II trial of pre-operative fulvestrant with or without enzalutamide for ER+/Her2- primary breast cancer: effects on tumor immune microenvironment and clinical outcomes.	Most ER+ breast cancers (BC) express androgen receptors (AR). This randomized phase II trial of 4 months of neoadjuvant fulvestrant (Fulv) alone or with enzalutamide (Combo) assessed whether the addition of AR blockade to Fulv would limit residual tumor at time of surgery, as measured by modified preoperative endocrine predictive index (PEPI) score. Eligible patients were women with ER+/HER2- primary BC cT2 or greater. Stratification factors were clinical node and T-stage. Fresh tumor biopsies were required at study entry, after 4 weeks on therapy (W5), and at surgery (W17). Laboratory analyses on tumors included immunochemistry (IHC) for ER/PR/AR/GR and Ki67 protein, evaluation of gene expression, multiplex for myeloid lineage immune cells, reverse phase protein array, and plasma metabolomic analyses. 59 out of 69 consented patients were evaluable. Toxicity was as expected with endocrine therapy. Combo achieved PEPI=0 more frequently (24%: 8/33) than Fulv (8%: 2/26). Ki67 was &lt;10% across arms by W5 or surgery in most patients (23/33 (70%) on Combo, 21/26 (81%) on Fulv). mTOR activation was elevated in tumors with poor Ki67 response. Tumors in both arms showed decreased estrogen-regulated and cell division gene sets, while Combo uniquely exhibited enrichment of immune activation genes sets, including interferon gamma, complement, inflammation, antigen processing, and B and T cell activation. Multiplex IHC showed significantly reduced tumor-associated macrophages and CD14+/HLADR-/CD68- MDSCs with Combo at W5. In summary, Combo achieved a higher PEPI=0 response, Ki67 response, and more activated tumor immune microenvironment than Fulv. The odds of response were 4.6-fold higher for patients with ILC versus IDC.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002065	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8PR7B			Changes in phospholipid fatty acid composition under cytotoxic stress facilitate peroxidation	Programs leading to cell death, such as apoptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis, involve an oxidative component linked to lipid metabolism that influences membrane homeostasis. Emerging evidence suggests inter-program cross-talk, emphasizing the need for overarching regulatory mechanisms. We show that under specific cytotoxic stress conditions, exogenous or released polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are channeled into overall depleting phospholipids that become vulnerable to peroxidation in the presence of associated redox stress. In fibroblasts, this reprogramming results from reduced growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, which reduces de novo fatty acid biosynthesis by mechanisms that differ depending on the specific cytotoxic stressors. We conclude that alterations in PUFA metabolism during cytotoxic stress render cells prone to oxidative modifications in phospholipids.

Among them, 8 differential metabolites had AUC &gt; 0.8, exhibiting distinct levels in the NSCLC and control EBC samples. Two OPLS-DA models were established from the differential metabolites with FDR &lt; 0.05 and FDR &lt; 0.01, with a 5-metabolite panel and a 4-metabolite panel, respectively. The OPLS-DA model achieved 86.2% sensitivity, 83.3% specificity and 84.9% accuracy for the 5-metabolite panel, and 79.3% sensitivity, 83.3% specificity and 81.1% accuracy for the 4-metabolite panel. The EBC differential metabolites between the NSCLC and control groups showed a potential to distinguish NSCLC from controls, which may provide assistance for noninvasive diagnosis of lung cancer, once they are validated in large cohort studies.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002067	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8F82F			Trained immunity in hematopoietic stem cell-derived macrophages is defined by a distinct metabolic and epigenetic state	In the present study, we investigate the contribution of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCLT) to trained immunity (TI) in the setting of chronic autoimmune disease. Using a mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we show that bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) from autoimmune mice exhibit hallmark features of TI, including increased Mycobacterium avium killing and inflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, these functional properties are mechanistically linked to increased glycolytic metabolism in BMDMs from primary autoimmune mice. While we find that HSC from autoimmune mice constitute a transplantable, long-term reservoir for macrophages that exhibit the functional properties of TI, these BMDMs exhibit a distinctive metabolic state typified by attenuated glycolytic activity. Furthermore, and in contrast to BMDMs from primary autoimmune mice, BMDMs and myeloid progenitors derived from autoimmune donor HSC exhibit a unique pattern of molecular remodeling characterized by reduced chromatin accessibility at a broad array of metabolic genes, while retaining elevated expression of TI-associated transcriptional regulators such as Jun and Fos. Taken together, our data show that HSC exposed to autoimmune inflammation gives rise to macrophages in which the hallmark functional properties of TI are decoupled from glycolytic metabolism. Altogether, our data support a model in which TI is characterized by a spectrum of distinct molecular and metabolic states capable of driving augmented immune function.

For this purpose, eight mouse strains were fed either a chow control diet or a western-style diet enriched in lipid, carbohydrate and cholesterol for 30-32 weeks, followed by in-depth metabolic phenotyping, assessment of liver pathology and the hepatic lipidome by LC/MS.  This study found that resistance to diet-induced NASH in BALB/c mice was associated with increased hepatic phosphatidylserine (PS) content. Subsequent studies focusing on overexpression of PS synthase 1 (PSS1) in the livers of mice with steatosis or NASH show that increasing hepatic PS is associated with improvements in steatosis and/or inflammation.

The study began in April 2014 and concluded in March of 2017.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002070	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M81Z4C			Increased Cholesterol Synthesis Drives Neurotoxicity in Patient Stem Cell-Derived Model of Multiple Sclerosis	Senescent neural progenitor cells have been identified in brain lesions of people with progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS). However, their role in disease pathobiology and contribution to the lesion environment remains unclear. By establishing directly induced neural stem/progenitor cell (iNSC) lines from PMS patient fibroblasts, we studied their senescent phenotype in vitro. Senescence was strongly associated with inflammatory signaling, hypermetabolism, and the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). PMS-derived iNSCs displayed increased glucose-dependent fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, which resulted in the accumulation of cholesteryl ester-enriched lipid droplets. An HMG-CoA reductase-mediated lipogenic state was found to induce secretion of the SASP in PMS iNSC conditioned media via transcriptional regulation by cholesterol-dependent transcription factors. SASP from PMS iNSCs induced neurotoxicity. Chemical targeting of HMG-CoA reductase using the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin (SV) reprogrammed the SASP and rescued neurotoxicity. Our findings suggest a disease-associated, cholesterol-related, hypermetabolic phenotype of PMS iNSCs that leads to neurotoxic signaling and is rescuable pharmacologically.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002072	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8SF9X			Urine Metabolite Profiling in Indian Male Population using Liquid Chromatography –Mass Spectrometry: A Longitudinal Pilot Study	People who visit high altitude (HA) for work, pilgrimage, recreation purposes or deployment are subjected to environmental stresses such as low temperature, atmospheric pressure leading to hypoxia, high radiations, dry air, non-availability of fresh food and vegetables, etc. These environmental stressors pose significant physiological effects on the human body. Among these challenges, hypobaric hypoxia at high altitude affects the aerobic metabolism and thereby reducing the supply of metabolic energy. These alterations could further lead to extreme environment-related maladaptation as evidenced by changes in metabolites and metabolic pathways. In order to investigate the variation in metabolite prfile, urine samples were collected from 16 individual at base line (BL) and at High altitude (HA, 4420m). Untargeted urine metabolic profiling was performed using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in conjunction with statistical analysis. Univariate and Multivariate statistical analysis revealed 33 metabolites based on fold change, (FC &gt;2 and &lt; 0.5), VIP score (&gt;1) and p value (&lt;0.05). These 33 metabolites were primarily associated with pathways related to Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, Phenylalanine metabolism, Biotin metabolism, Cysteine and methionine metabolism, Tyrosine metabolism, Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, Pentose and glucuronate interconversions, Vitamin B6 metabolism, Citrate cycle (TCA cycle) and Porphyrin metabolism. Further, ROC analysis detected 5 metabolites i.e., 2-Tetrahydrothiopheneacetic acid (AUC: 0.97266), 1-Benzyl-7,8-dimethoxy-3-phenyl-3H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]isoquinoline (AUC: 0.92969), Abietin (AUC:0.917), 4,4'-Thiobis-2-butanone (AUC: 0.917), and Hydroxyisovaleroyl carnitine (AUC: 0.910) with a high range of sensitivity and specificity. In summary, this present longitudinal study demonstrated metabolic changes in human exposed to high altitude, via utilising the potential application of LC-MS metabolomics. These findings will shed light on the impact of hypoxic exposure on metabolic adaptation and provide a better understanding about the pathophysiological mechanism of HA related illnesses correlated to tissue hypoxia.

As different tissues have varying levels of radiosensitivity, e.g. hematopoietic vs. gastrointestinal tissues, the effects of shielding on radiation biomarkers needs to be addressed. Here, we explore how biofluid (urine and serum) metabolite signatures from male and female C57BL/6 mice exposed to VHDR (5 – 10 Gy/sec) total body irradiation (TBI, 0, 4, and 8 Gy) compare to individuals exposed to partial body irradiation (PBI) (lower body irradiated [LBI] or upper body irradiated [UBI] at an 8 Gy dose) using a data-independent acquisition untargeted metabolomics approach. Although sex differences were observed in the spatial groupings of urine signatures from TBI and PBI mice, a metabolite signature (N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine, carnitine, propionylcarnitine, hexosamine-valine-isoleucine, taurine, and creatine) previously developed from variable dose rate experiments was able to identify individuals with high sensitivity and specificity irrespective of radiation shielding. A panel of serum metabolites composed from previous untargeted studies on nonhuman primates had excellent performance for separating irradiated cohorts; however, a multi-omic approach to complement the metabolome could increase dose estimation confidence intervals. Overall, these results support the inclusion of small molecule markers in biodosimetry assays without substantial interference from upper or lower body shielding.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002074	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8HZ53			Biological stress metabolomics in Duchenne muscular dystrophy rodent model	Our goal is to identify stress-relevant metabolomic alterations in dystrophin-deficient organisms following physiological stress exposure. Here we performed a targeted mass spectrometry-based plasma metabolomics screen through Metabolon that focused on biological stress pathways in healthy and dystrophin-deficient mdx mice exposed to mild scruff stress. One-third of the stress-relevant metabolites interrogated displayed significant elevation or depletion in mdx plasma after scruff stress and were restored to WT by skeletal muscle-specific dystrophin expression. The metabolic pathways of mdx mice altered by scruff stress are associated with regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, locomotor tone, neurocognitive function, redox metabolism, cellular bioenergetics, and protein catabolism. Our data suggest that a mild stress triggers an exaggerated, multi-system metabolic response in mdx mice.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002075	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8D824			The effect of rewarming ischemia on tissue transcriptome and metabolome signatures: a clinical observational study in lung transplantation	BACKGROUND: In lung transplantation (LuTx), various ischemic phases exist, yet the rewarming ischemia time (RIT) during implantation has often been overlooked. During RIT, lungs are deflated and exposed to the body temperature in the recipient's chest cavity. Our prior clinical findings demonstrated that prolonged RIT increases the risk of primary graft dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanisms of rewarming ischemic injury in this context remain unexplored. We aimed to characterize the rewarming ischemia phase during LuTx by measuring organ temperature and comparing transcriptome and metabolome profiles in tissue obtained at the end versus the start of implantation. METHODS: In a clinical observational study, 34 double-LuTx with ice preservation were analyzed. Lung core and surface temperature (n=65 and 55 lungs) was measured during implantation. Biopsies (n=59 lungs) were wedged from right middle lobe and left lingula at start and end of implantation. Tissue transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling were performed. RESULTS: Temperature increased rapidly during implantation, reaching core/surface temperatures of 21.5°C/25.4°C within 30min. Transcriptomics showed increased pro-inflammatory signaling and oxidative stress at the end of implantation. Upregulation of NLRP3 and NFKB1 correlated with RIT. Metabolomics indicated elevated levels of amino acids, hypoxanthine, uric acid, cysteineglutathione disulfide alongside decreased levels of glucose and carnitines. Arginine, tyrosine, and 1-carboxyethylleucine showed correlation with incremental RIT. CONCLUSIONS: The final rewarming ischemia phase in LuTx involves rapid organ rewarming, accompanied by transcriptomic and metabolomic changes indicating pro-inflammatory signaling and disturbed cell metabolism. Limiting implantation time and lung cooling represent potential interventions to alleviate rewarming ischemic injury.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002076	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M88G1K			Characterization of Metabolic and Molecular Effects Following Dietary Exposure to the Plasticizer DINCH in vivo	With the phthalate plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) being restricted because of its harmful health impacts, it has been replaced by alternatives such as diisononylcyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (DINCH). Although recent research suggests that the main metabolite of DINCH, monoisononylcyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid ester (MINCH), promotes adipocyte differentiation in vitro, in vivo studies have not shown changes in body weight, lipid metabolism, or adipogenic effects. However, these studies followed OECD guidelines, which are not specifically designed to detect potential metabolic disruptions in adipose tissue. Therefore, we conducted an in-depth in vivo study using the C57BL/6N mouse model to comprehensively evaluate the physiological and functional impacts of DINCH exposure on adipose tissue, including molecular-level effects.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002077	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M84R60			Validation of ferroptosis in canine cancer cells to enable comparative oncology and translational medicine	Ferroptosis is a cell death mechanism that has attracted significant attention as a potential basis for the development of new cancer therapies. Validation of ferroptosis biology in species commonly used in translation and pre-clinical development is a necessary foundation for enabling the advancement of such ferroptosis modulating drugs. Here, we demonstrate that canine cancer cells exhibit sensitivity to a wide range of ferroptosis-inducing perturbations in a manner indistinguishable from human cancer cells, and recapitulate characteristic patterns of ferroptotic response across tumor types seen in the human setting. We further performed lipidomic profiling of all canine cancer cell lines to enable the discovery of lipid biomarkers for ferroptosis sensitivity. The foundation provided herein establishes the dog as a relevant efficacy and toxicology model for ferroptosis and creates new opportunities to leverage the canine comparative oncology paradigm to accelerate the development of ferroptosis-inducing drugs for human cancer patients.

Here, the tissue-specific impact of specifier proteins on the outcome of glucosinolate hydrolysis in nine kohlrabi tissues was investigated. Glucosinolates and their hydrolysis product profiles, epithiospecifier protein and myrosinase activity and protein abundance patterns of key glucosinolate biosynthesis, transport and hydrolysis proteins were determined and correlated to the metabolites in the kohlrabi tissues. Leaf tissues were rich in glucoraphanin, while bulb tissues contained more glucoerucin. Moreover, a higher proportion of isothiocyanates was formed in leaf stalk, bulb peel, stem and root, tissues with relatively higher ESM1 abundance and a higher ratio of myrosinase activity to ESP activity. This study shows that tissue-specific glucosinolate hydrolysis is mediated by glucosinolate biosynthesis and profiles, myrosinase activity and specifier protein as well as modifier protein abundance.

Although proteomics and metabolomic profiling offer the potential to elucidating such biological markers, reports of meth-odological approaches for carrying this out in S. aureus isolates remain limited. We describe the use of a dual-functionality methanol extraction method for the concur-rent extraction of protein and metabolites from S. aureus and report on the com-parative analysis of the proteomic and metabolomic profiles of MRSA versus methi-cillin sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Methods: Bacterial reference strains MRSA ATCC43300 and MSSA ATCC25923 were used . The conventional urea methodology was used for protein extraction and a methanol based method was used for concurrent proteins and metabolites extraction. Proteomic and metabolomic profiling was carried out using TimsTOF mass spectrometry. Data processing was carried out using the MaxQuant version 2.1.4.0 Results: This study represents the first report on the utilization of the methanol ex-traction method for concurrent protein and metabolite extraction in Gram positive bacteria. Our findings demonstrate good performance of the method for the dual extraction of proteins and metabolites from S. aureus with demonstration of repro-ducibility.Comparison of MRSA and MSSA strains revealed 407 proteins with significantly different expression levels. Enrichment analysis of those proteins re-vealed distinct pathways involved in fatty acid degradation, metabolism and beta-lactam resistance. Penicillin-binding protein PBP2a, the key determinant of MRSA resistance, exhibited distinct expression patterns in MRSA isolates. Metabolomic analysis identified 146 metabolites with only one exclusive to the MRSA. The enriched pathways identified were related to arginine metabolism and biosynthesis. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the methanol-based dual-extraction method, providing simultaneous insights into the proteomic and metabolomic landscapes of S. aureus strains. These findings demonstrate the utility of proteomic and metabolomic profiling for elucidating the biological basis of antimicrobial resistance.

We demonstrate that the translation of NRF2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2), a master regulator of antioxidant response, is controlled by the OGDH (2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex component E1)-METTL3 (N6-adenosine-methyltransferase catalytic subunit) axis in melanoma for glucose starvation adaptation. To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of the OGDH-METTL3 axis during glucose starvation, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis to identify the binding partner of OGDH that governs both the OGDH-METTL3 axis and tumor cell adaptation to glucose deprivation.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002082	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8H24R			ADSL deficiency drives mitochondrial dysfunction and ERK2 dysregulation in a linear genotype to phenotype correlation	Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) deficiency (ADSLd) is a rare autosomal recessive defect of purine metabolism associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations. Despite ADSL implication in purine synthesis, no additional molecular alterations have been identified as a cause of ADSLd besides the accumulation of toxic substrates. Here we uncover a novel association between ADSLd and mitochondrial dysfunction, which is characterized by an increase in fragmentation and reduction in respiration and ATP production. The extent of this mitochondrial dysfunction is directly proportional to the pathological manifestations of ADSLd, which are predominantly observed in tissues that rely heavily on mitochondria. Our analysis also unveils a striking defect in mitochondrial dynamics and transport, which are associated with the suppression of ERK2 and AKT function. Remarkably, the mitochondrial phenotype can be rescued in part by overexpression of a constitutive form of ERK2 or through the administration of purine intermediates. This scenario provides an alternative explanation of ADSLd onset, reorienting research towards developing innovative therapeutic strategies based on the restoration of mitochondrial metabolism.

Blood samples were collected at four time points: pre-exercise (REST), immediately post-exercise (STAT), 3 hours into recovery (REC3), and 22 hours post-exercise (REC22). A total of 859 metabolites were identified through the untargeted method, and 465 metabolites and 411 lipids were identified through the targeted methods. Rigorous quality control measures were implemented throughout the study to ensure data reliability. The comprehensive dataset, which is publicly available on the Metabolomics Workbench website, offers valuable insights into the systemic metabolic shifts triggered by endurance exercise. This resource may prove instrumental in uncovering biomarkers associated with athletic performance, providing a foundation for future research in exercise physiology and metabolic health.

Additionally, we analyzed lipid metabolites in plasma and liver of Ldlr-/- mice fed high-fat diets enriched in cis or trans fatty acids in the presence or absence of myriocin, a pharmacological inhibitor of Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the initial rate-limiting enzyme of sphingolipid biosynthesis.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002086	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8025G			Noninvasive multiomic measurement of cell type repertoires in human urine	Background: Early detection of the cell type changes underlying several genitourinary tract diseases largely remains an unmet clinical need, whereas existing assays, if available, lack the cellular resolution afforded by an invasive biopsy. While messenger RNA in urine could reflect dynamic signal that facilitates early detection, current measurements primarily detect single genes and thus do not capture the full spectrum of cell type specific contributions. Methods: We isolated and sequenced the cellular and cell-free RNA from urine samples (n = 6healthy controls and n = 12 kidney stones) alongside the metabolome. We analyzed the resulting urine transcriptomes and metabolomes by comparing the bulk gene expression, deconvolving the noninvasively measurable cell type contributions, and comparing to the plasma cell-free transcriptome. Results: We primarily observed signal originating from genitourinary tract cell types in addition to cell types from high-turnover solid tissues beyond the genitourinary tract. Integration of urinary transcriptomic and metabolomic measurements identified various metabolic pathways involved in amino acid metabolism overlap with metabolic subsystems associated with proximal tubule function. Conclusions: Noninvasive whole transcriptome measurements of human urine reflect signal from hard-to-biopsy tissues exhibiting low representation in the blood at cell type resolution.

Untargeted and targeted analysis were employed to enable high identification coverage and accurate quantification of lipids. Chromatographic separation modes (C18 RPC, C30 RPC) was combined with MS analysis using various acquisition modes (full MS, DDA, SRM) to allow for the identification of 1084 lipid molecular species across 28 lipid subclasses, of which 480 lipids were semi-absolutely quantified.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002092	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M86J89			An untargeted metabolomic analysis of acute AFB1 treatment in liver, breast, and lung cells	Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a class 1 carcinogen and mycotoxin known to contribute to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), growth impairment, altered immune system modulation, and malnutrition. AFB1 is synthesized by Aspergillus flavus and is known to widely contaminate foodstuffs, particularly maize, wheat, and groundnuts. The mechanism in which AFB1 causes genetic mutations has been well studied, however its metabolomic effects remained largely unknown. A better understanding of how AFB1 disrupts metabolism would provide insight into how this mycotoxin leads to carcinogenesis, growth impairment, and/or immunomodulation, and may reveal potential targets for pharmacological or nutritional interventions to protect against these effects. The current study evaluated the metabolomic effects of various doses (2.5 µM, 5 µM, 10uM) of AFB1 treatment to HepG2 (liver), MDA-MB-231 (breast), and A549 (lung) cells. Treated and control cells’ metabolomic profiles were evaluated via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed significant alterations in metabolite concentrations from each dose of AFB1 treatment in each cell type. Pathway analysis was then used to understand broader biochemical functions affected by AFB1 treatment in each cell type. HepG2 cell pathway analyses revealed significant pathway perturbations in lipid metabolism, carnitine synthesis, catecholamine biosynthesis, purine metabolism, and spermidine and spermine biosynthesis. Analysis of A549 cells found a greater emphasis of perturbations on various amino acids along with lipid synthesis-related pathways, and catecholamine biosynthesis. Finally, analysis of treated MDA-MB-231 cells found spermidine and spermine biosynthesis, carnitine synthesis, plasma membrane-related pathways (phosphatidylcholine synthesis and alpha linolenic acid and linoleic acid metabolism), and various amino acid metabolism pathways to be most affected. These highlighted pathways should be targeted in future investigations to evaluate their potential in mitigating or preventing the development of negative health effects associated with AFB1 exposure.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002094	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8Z221			Bempedoic acid suppresses diet-induced hepatic steatosis independent of ACLY	ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) synthesizes acetyl-CoA for de novo lipogenesis (DNL), which is elevated in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Hepatic ACLY is inhibited by the LDL-cholesterol lowering drug bempedoic acid (BPA), which also improves steatosis in mice. Indeed, BPA potently suppresses hepatic DNL and increases fat catabolism. However, it is unclear if ACLY is the relevant molecular target in reducing liver triglyceride, particularly since the acetyl-CoA synthetase ACSS2 can compensate for ACLY deficiency to provision acetyl-CoA for DNL. We show that on a Western diet, loss of hepatic ACLY alone or ACLY and ACSS2 together unexpectedly exacerbates steatosis, linked to reduced hepatic abundance of endogenous PPAR ligands and lower expression of PPAR target genes controlling fatty acid oxidation. Importantly, BPA treatment ameliorates WD-mediated triglyceride accumulation in both WT and liver ACLY knockout mice, indicating that its primary effects on hepatic lipid metabolism are independent of ACLY. Together, these data indicate that hepatic ACLY plays an unexpected role in restraining diet-dependent lipid accumulation, and that BPA improves steatosis independent of ACLY.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002095	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8TC1H			Effects of Aldehydes on lipid metabolism in mice	Obesity and fatty liver diseases-metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD and MASH) affect over a third of the global population and are exacerbated in individuals with reduced functional aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), observed in approximately 560 million people. Current treatment to prevent disease progression to cancer remains inadequate, requiring innovative approaches. We observe that Aldh2-/- and Aldh2-/-Sptbn1+/- mice develop phenotypes of human Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) and MASH with a striking accumulation of endogenous aldehydes such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). While phospholipids are often modified by reactive aldehydes that accumulate in the absence of ALDH2, to understand the mechanisms for the differences in liver metabolism in ASKO mice, we analyzed liver metabolomics and lipidomics from mice models. Briefly, C57BL/6 mice (n=15) were from 3 groups (WT, Aldh2-/-(ko), Aldh2-/-Sptbn1+/-(double), n=5 per group) and fed normal chow diet for 10 months. For quality control, 6 QC samples were also included in the analysis (total 21 samples). We observed that livers of Aldh2-/-Sptbn1+/- mice had substantially higher levels of all investigated phospholipids, including ≥ 2-fold increase in 26% of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipid types and ≥ 2-fold increase in 32% of phosphatidylserine (PS) lipid types, compared to livers of WT mice. Similarly, increased abundances of TGs and diacylglycerides (DGs) lipid types were also observed in the livers of Aldh2-/-Sptbn1+/- mice. These results demonstrated that Aldehydes altered lipid metabolism which may be implicated in the progression of liver MetS, MASLD/MASH in Aldh2-/-Sptbn1+/- mice.

Despite the potential insights provid-ed by this technique, its application remains limited to a small number of targeted molecules and pathways. Because previ-ous software tools usually require chemical formulas to find relevant features, and the data are highly complex, especially in untargeted metabolomics and when the reactions and metabolites downstream the labeled substrates are poorly characterized. We report here Khipu version 2 and its new user-friendly web application. New functions are added to enhance analyzing stable isotope tracing data including metrics that evaluate peak enrichment in labeled samples, scoring methods to facilitate robust detection of intensity patterns and integrated natural abundance correction. We demonstrate that this approach can be applied to untargeted metabolomics to systematically extract isotope-labeled compounds and annotate the unidentified me-tabolites.

We discovered PIP4K2C’s (Phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase, type II, gamma) roles in SARS-CoV-2 entry, RNA replication, and assembly/egress, validating it as a druggable antiviral target. Integrating proteomics, single-cell transcriptomics, and functional assays revealed that PIP4K2C binds SARS-CoV-2 proteins and regulates virus-induced impairment of autophagic flux. Reversing this autophagic flux impairment is a mechanism of antiviral action of RMC-113(dual lipid kinase inhibitor (PIP4K2C and PIKfyve). These findings reveal virus-induced autophagy regulation via PIP4K2C, an understudied kinase, and propose dual inhibition of PIP4K2C (Phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase, type II, gamma) and PIKfyve (a FYVE finger-containing phosphoinositide kinase) as a candidate strategy to combat emerging viruses.

Secreted phospholipase A2 group X (sPLA2-X) is abundantly expressed in colonic epithelial cells but is barely detectable in metabolic and immune tissues. Despite this distribution, sPLA2-X-deficient (Pla2g10-/-) mice displayed variable obesity-related phenotypes that were abrogated after treatment with antibiotics or cohousing with Pla2g10+/+ mice, suggesting the involvement of gut microbiota. Under housing conditions where Pla2g10-/- mice showed aggravation of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, they displayed increased colonic inflammation and epithelial damage, reduced production of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and lysophospholipids, decreased abundance of several Clostridium species, and reduced levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These obesity-related phenotypes in Pla2g10-/- mice were reversed by dietary supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs or SCFAs. Thus, colonic sPLA2-X orchestrates omega-3 PUFA-SCFA interplay via modulation of gut microbiota, thereby secondarily affecting systemic metabolism.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002104	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8NJ9Q			Specific activation of the integrated stress response uncovers regulation of central carbon metabolism and lipid droplet biogenesis	The integrated stress response (ISR) enables cells to cope with a variety of insults, but its specific contribution to downstream cellular outputs remains unclear. Using a synthetic tool, we selectively activate the ISR without co-activation of parallel pathways and define the resulting cellular state with multi-omics profiling. We identify time- and dose-dependent gene expression modules, with ATF4 driving only a small but sensitive subgroup that includes amino acid metabolic enzymes. This ATF4 response affects cellular bioenergetics, rerouting carbon utilization towards amino acid production and away from the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid synthesis. We also find an ATF4-independent reorganization of the lipidome that promotes DGAT-dependent triglyceride synthesis and accumulation of lipid droplets. While DGAT1 is the main driver of lipid droplet biogenesis, DGAT2 plays an essential role in buffering stress and maintaining cell survival. Together, we demonstrate the sufficiency of the ISR in promoting a previously unappreciated metabolic state.

Chemical biology which is the interface of chemistry and biology can make use of metabolomics approaches and tools to better understand molecular mechanisms operating in complex biological systems. Aim: Here we report on the untargeted metabolomics profiling of barley seedlings treated with 3,5-DCAA to gain deeper insights into the mechanism of action of this resistance inducer. Methodology: Hydro-methanolic extracts from different time periods (12, 24 and 36 h post-treatment) were analysed on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography hyphenated with a high-resolution mass spectrometer. Both unsupervised and supervised chemometric methods were used to reveal hidden patterns and highlight metabolite variables associated with the treatment. Results: Based on the metabolites identified, both the phenylpropanoid and octadecanoid pathways appear to be main route activated by 3,5-DCAA. Different classes of responsive metabolites were annotated with favonoids, more especially flavones, the most dominant. Given the limited understanding of this inducer, this study offers a metabolomics analysis of the response triggered by its foliar application in barley. This additional insight could help make informed decision for the development of more effective strategies for crop protection and improvement, ultimately contributing to agricultural sustainability and resilience.

However, recent years have unveiled potential risks of obesity promotion and insulin resistance associated with BPS, particularly during early life stages, although its precise impact remains inadequately understood. Addressing these concerns, this study established a mouse model to investigate the effects of maternal BPS exposure during pregnancy and lactation, combined with offspring consumption of a high-fat diet. The research examined physiological indicators related to obesity and insulin resistance in offspring, evaluated pathological changes in vital organs including the heart, liver, pancreas, white adipose tissue, and brown adipose tissue, conducted metabolomics perturbation analysis across multiple organs, and performed microbiome analysis based on fecal samples. Finally, correlations between phenotype, metabolome, and microbiome were explored to unravel intergenerational effects and mechanisms under BPS exposure, aiming to identify potential biomarkers of its effects.

The integrity of the lens plasma membrane is essential for maintaining lens cellular structure, homeostasis, and transparency. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a selenoenzyme, plays a critical role in protecting against lipid peroxidation. This study aims to elucidate the role of GPX4 in maintaining lens plasma membrane stability during lens development, utilizing in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo systems. By employing a lipidomics approach, we aim to understand the phospholipid profile of the lens plasma membrane and its alterations following the deletion of GPX4, a key lipid peroxidation detoxification enzyme. Our findings reveal that the deletion of lens-specific GPX4 results in a significant loss of unsaturated phospholipids and an increase in oxidized phospholipids. Consequently, lenses deficient in GPX4 exhibit massive disruption of lens fiber cell structure, significant loss of lens epithelial cells via ferroptosis, and the formation of congenital cataracts. Our study underscores the crucial role of GPX4 in lens development and transparency and offers a potential intervention strategy to prevent lens developmental defects by inhibiting lipid peroxidation.

CDK4/6 inhibition in combination with endocrine therapy is the standard of care for estrogen receptor (ER+) breast cancer, and although cytostasis is frequently observed, new treatment strategies that enhance efficacy are required. We performed two independent genome-wide CRISPR screens to identify genetic determinants of CDK4/6 and endocrine therapy sensitivity. Genes involved in oxidative stress and ferroptosis modulated sensitivity, with GPX4 the top sensitiser in both screens. Depletion or inhibition of GPX4 increased sensitivity to palbociclib and giredestrant, and their combination, in ER+ breast cancer models, with GPX4 null xenografts being highly sensitive to palbociclib. GPX4 perturbation additionally sensitised triple negative breast cancer models to palbociclib. Palbociclib and giredestrant induced oxidative stress and disordered lipid metabolism, leading to a ferroptosis-sensitive state. Lipid peroxidation was promoted by a peroxisome AGPAT3-dependent pathway in ER+ breast cancer models, rather than the classical ACSL4 pathway. Our data demonstrate that CDK4/6 and ER inhibition creates vulnerability to ferroptosis induction, that could be exploited through combination with GPX4 inhibitors, to enhance sensitivity to the current therapies in breast cancer.

Here, this approach is used to elucidate the effects of five cytotoxic gold compounds in A2780 human ovarian cancer cells. Namely, two close analogues of auranofin (AF), AFCl and AFI, a gold(I) triphenylphosphine complex, (Ph3P)AuI, and two representative gold(III) compounds, AuL12 and Aubipyc, were investigated. Interestingly, the three gold(I) compounds were found to induce similar and pronounced metabolic changes in the lysates and growth media, whereas the two gold(III) compounds induced only minor changes. The results are analysed and discussed in the context of the existing knowledge on gold-based anticancer drugs, their modes of action and their effects on cellular metabolism. To this end, we included in our dataset four additional gold-based drugs, already individually investigated in previous studies. Statistical tools are used to highlight similarities and differences between the various compounds. Attempts are made to establish well-defined structure-function relationships within the set of tested gold compounds
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002115	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M87C0V			TRAM–LAG1–CLN8 family proteins are acyltransferases regulating phospholipid composition	The diversity of cellular phospholipids, crucial for membrane homeostasis and function, arises from enzymatic remodeling of their fatty acyl chains. In this work, we reveal that poorly understood TRAM–LAG1–CLN8 domain-containing (TLCD) proteins are phospholipid remodeling enzymes. We demonstrate that TLCD1 is an evolutionarily conserved lysophosphatidylethanolamine acyltransferase, which regulates cellular phospholipid composition and generates novel fatty acid and thiamine (vitamin B1) esters as its secondary products. Furthermore, we establish that human TLCD protein CLN8, mutations in which cause fatal neurodegenerative Batten disease, is a lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase. We show that CLN8 catalyzes the essential step in the biosynthesis of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, a phospholipid critical for lysosome function. Our study unveils a new family of acyltransferases integral to cellular membrane phospholipid homeostasis and human disease.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002116	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M83N8D			Bempedoic acid improves diet-induced steatosis independent of hepatic ACLY	ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) synthesizes acetyl-CoA for de novo lipogenesis (DNL), which is elevated in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Hepatic ACLY is inhibited by the LDL-cholesterol lowering drug bempedoic acid (BPA), which also improves steatosis in mice. Indeed, BPA potently suppresses hepatic DNL and increases fat catabolism. However, it is unclear if ACLY is the relevant molecular target in reducing liver triglyceride, particularly since the acetyl-CoA synthetase ACSS2 can compensate for ACLY deficiency to provision acetyl-CoA for DNL. We show that on a Western diet, loss of hepatic ACLY alone or ACLY and ACSS2 together unexpectedly exacerbates steatosis, linked to reduced hepatic abundance of endogenous PPARa (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha) ligands and lower expression of PPARa target genes controlling fatty acid oxidation. Importantly, BPA treatment ameliorates Western diet-mediated triglyceride accumulation in both WT and liver ACLY knockout mice, indicating that its primary effects on hepatic lipid metabolism are independent of ACLY. Together, these data indicate that hepatic ACLY plays an unexpected role in restraining diet-dependent lipid accumulation, and that BPA improves steatosis independent of ACLY.

However, there is still no effective way to consistently boost mucosal IgA responses, and the factors influencing these responses are not fully understood. We observed that colonization with the murine intestinal symbiotic protozoan Tritrichomonas musculis (T.mu) boosted antigen-specific mucosal IgA responses in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. This enhancement was attributed to the accumulation of free arachidonic acid (ARA) in the intestinal lumen, which served as a signal to stimulate the production of antigen-specific mucosal IgA. When ARA was prevented from undergoing its downstream metabolic transformation using the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton or by blocking its downstream biological signaling through genetic deletion of the Leukotriene B4 receptor 1 (Blt1), the T.mu-mediated enhancement of antigen-specific mucosal IgA production was suppressed. Moreover, both T.mu transfer and dietary supplementation of ARA augmented the efficacy of an oral vaccine against Salmonella infection, with this effect being dependent on Blt1. Our findings elucidate a tripartite circuit linking nutrients from the diet or intestinal microbiota, host lipid metabolism, and the mucosal humoral immune response.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002120	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8KN7C			White adipose tissue remodeling in Little Brown Myotis (Myotis lucifugus) with white-nose syndrome	White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a fungal wildlife disease of bats that has caused precipitous declines in certain Nearctic bat species. A key driver of mortality is premature exhaustion of fat reserves, primarily white adipose tissue (WAT), that bats rely on to meet their metabolic needs during winter. However, the pathophysiological and metabolic effects of WNS have remained ill-defined. To elucidate metabolic mechanisms associated with WNS mortality, we infected a WNS susceptible species, the Little Brown Myotis (Myotis lucifugus), with Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd) and collected WAT biopsies for histology and targeted lipidomics. These results were compared to the WNS-resistant Big Brown Bat (Eptesicus fuscus). A similar distribution in broad lipid class was observed in both species, with total WAT primarily consisting of triacylglycerides. Baseline differences in WAT chemical composition between species showed that higher glycerophospholipids (GPs) levels in E. fuscus were dominated by unsaturated or monounsaturated moieties and n-6 (18:2, 20:2, 20:3, 20:4) fatty acids. Conversely, higher GP levels in M. lucifugus WAT were primarily compounds containing n-3 (20:5 and 22:5) fatty acids. Following Pd-infection, we found that perturbation to WAT reserves occurs in M. lucifugus, but not in the resistant E. fuscus. A total of 66 GPs (primarily glycerophosphocholines and glycerophosphoethanolamines) were higher in Pd-infected M. lucifugus, indicating perturbation to the WAT structural component. In addition to changes in lipid chemistry, smaller adipocyte sizes and increased extracellular matrix deposition was observed in Pd-infected M. lucifugus. This is the first study to describe WAT GP composition of bats with different susceptibilities to WNS and highlights that recovery from WNS may require repair from adipose remodeling in addition to replenishing depot fat during spring emergence.

We developed a Drosophila model for identifying novel glial- based therapeutic targets for PD. Human α-synuclein is expressed in neurons and individual genes are independently knocked down in glia. We performed a forward genetic screen, knocking down the entire Drosophila kinome in glia in α-synuclein expressing flies. Among the top hits were five genes (Ak1, Ak6, Adk1, Adk2, and awd) involved in adenosine metabolism. Knockdown of each gene improved locomotor dysfunction, rescued neurodegeneration, and increased brain adenosine levels. We determined that the mechanism of neuroprotection involves adenosine itself, as opposed to a downstream metabolite. We dove deeper into the mechanism for one gene, Ak1, finding rescue of dopaminergic neuron loss, α-synuclein aggregation, and bioenergetic dysfunction after glial Ak1 knockdown. We performed metabolomics in Drosophila and in human PD patients, allowing us to comprehensively characterize changes in purine metabolism and identify potential biomarkers of dysfunctional adenosine metabolism in people. These experiments support glial adenosine as a novel therapeutic target in PD.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we find Ae. albopictus shows comparable vector competence to ZIKV/DENV with Ae. aegypti by blood-feeding after antibiotic treatment or intrathoracic injection. This suggests that midgut microbiota can influence vector competence. Enterobacter hormaechei_B17 (Eh_B17) is isolated from field-collected Ae. albopictus and conferred resistance to ZIKV/DENV infection in Ae. aegypti after gut-transplantation. Sphingosine, a metabolite secreted by Eh_B17, effectively suppresses ZIKV infection in both Ae. aegypti and cell cultures by blocking viral entry during the fusion step, with an IC50 of approximately 10 μM. A field survey reveals that Eh_B17 preferentially colonizes Ae. albopictus compared to Ae. aegypti. And field Ae. aegypti positive for Eh_B17 are more resistant to ZIKV infection. These findings underscore the potential of gut symbiotic bacteria, such as Eh_B17, to modulate the arbovirus vector competence of Aedes mosquitoes. As a natural antiviral agent, Eh_B17 holds promise as a potential candidate for blocking ZIKV/DENV transmission.

Radiation-induced liver damage (RILD) is a disease characterized by a series of physiological and pathological changes in liver tissue following exposure to a certain dose of radiation, and it is also a common complication of liver cancer and abdominal tumor radiotherapy. To date, the pathogenesis of RILD remains unclear, and effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are lacking. Based on this, the present study established an animal model of radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) using whole-liver irradiated rats. Metabolomics and transcriptomics were integrated to analyze liver tissue samples collected 7 days post-irradiation. The involved metabolic disorders primarily include ammonia metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism and lipid metabolism. Moreover, a panel of potential plasma metabolic markers was identified through correlation analysis between liver tissue and plasma metabolic characteristics. Subsequently, the levels of radiation injury within 7 days post irradiation were assessed. This study provides experimental evidence for the identification of early diagnostic markers for whole-liver irradiation and RILD, as well as for exploring the molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms of RILD.

Aquatic organisms can be chronically exposed to PhACs during critical periods of their life or even through multi-generations. This may result in severe physiological/metabolic/endocrine disturbances, not only through direct exposure but also through inter- and transgenerational inheritance (in the absence of the insult). Special attention is given to simvastatin, one of the PhACs most prescribed to humans for the primary treatment of hypercholesterolemia, known to affect endocrine functions and disrupt reproduction, development, neuronal processes and/or other important physiological responses; not only in exposed individuals, but also in subsequent non-exposed generations. Previous studies observed that direct exposure and transgenerational exposure to simvastatin has been found to impact severely on crustaceans’ reproduction, growth and development, although the underlying mechanism remains partially unclear. NMR metabolomic approaches may provide crucial complementary mechanistic information about the cascade of metabolic events occurring with exposure. In this study a comprehensive untargetd 1H NMR metabolomics study was applied to measure the metabolic effects of direct exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of simvastatin (F0) and transgenerational exposure (F3, where only the F0 generation was exposed) on the keystone marine amphipod species Gammarus locusta. Furthermore, NMR is here employed for the first time to address G. locusta metabolic behavior. The obtained data added important knowledge, paving the way to an improved understanding of the metabolic events cascade associated with simvastatin exposure.

Organic grass-fed (GRA) and conventional (CON) cattle feeding systems may result in beef products with differing metabolite profiles, and therefore could impact the postprandial metabolomic response of consumers. This study aims to measure whole beef metabolomics and postprandial metabolomic response of consumers between GRA and CON beef to elucidate potential health implications. This study followed a double-blind, crossover design with healthy male and female subjects (n=10). Serum samples were taken at fasting (0) and postprandially for four hours after consumption of a steak from each condition. Untargeted metabolomic analysis of whole beef and human serum samples utilized LC/MS. Multivariate and pathway enrichment analysis in MetaboAnalyst was used to investigate metabolite and biochemical pathways that distinguished CON and GRA. Cattle feeding systems impacted both postprandial and whole beef steak metabolomic profiles. Metabolites that contributed to this variation included carnitine species (Proionylcarnitine), fatty acids, amino acids (L-Valine) and Calamendiol. These metabolites have been associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, and cardiovascular health. Functional pathway enrichment analysis revealed numerous amino acid degradation pathways, especially branched chain amino acids, and fatty acid degradation that changed throughout the postprandial time course. These findings suggest that CON and GRA cattle feeding systems differentially impact whole beef metabolomics, as well as consumer postprandial metabolic responses and the associated health implications.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002134	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8S53W			Differentially Altered Hepatocellular Global Metabolome in Response to Endotoxemia and Lipotoxicity	The primary focus of the paper revolves around the exploration of the distinct impacts of endotoxemia, induced by gut-derived endotoxin, and lipotoxicity, resulting from adipose-derived free non-esterified fatty acids, on the untargeted global metabolome of hepatocytes. The study elucidates the pivotal significance of these two parameters on hepatotoxicity associated with the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The study highlights the liver as a principal site for metabolic damage, which occurs primarily via two main pathways. One of the pathways includes the transportation of microbial products from the gut, namely endotoxin, which triggers the activation of hepatic Kupffer cells and subsequently induces inflammation in the liver. The second pathway encompasses the consequences of lipotoxicity, which arises from the relocation of fatty acids from adipose tissue to the liver, ultimately leading to the development of hepatic steatosis. The study used HepG2 cells as a model system to assess the individual impacts of endotoxin (LPS) and fatty acids on the intracellular global metabolome. This study elucidates the distinct effects of these two parameters on the overall metabolic balance of hepatocytes. The manuscript highlights the significance of comprehending the distinct impacts of endotoxemia and lipotoxicity on hepatocellular metabolism, particularly in relation to the growing incidence of lean nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This form of NASH is not linked to obesity or lipotoxicity originating from adipose tissue. Moreover, it underscores the importance of metabolomics in the detection of biomarkers, comprehension of disease processes, and formulation of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for liver illnesses and metabolic disorders.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002135	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8NG0M			Gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of liver hepatic extracts from adult male C57BL/6NCrl mice exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin	Epidemiological evidence suggests an association between dioxin and dioxin-like compound (DLC) exposure and human liver disease. The prototypical DLC, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), has been shown to induce the progression of reversible hepatic steatosis to steatohepatitis with periportal fibrosis and biliary hyperplasia in C57BL/6NCrl mice. Although the effects of TCDD toxicity are mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation, the underlying mechanisms of TCDD-induced hepatotoxicity are unresolved. In the present study, male C57BL/6NCrl mice were gavaged every 4 days for 28 days with 0.03 - 30 µg/kg TCDD and evaluated for liver histopathology and gene expression as well as complementary 1-dimensional (1-D) 1H NMR urinary metabolic profiling. Urinary trimethylamine (TMA), trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), and 1-methylnicotinamide (1MN) levels were altered by TCDD at doses ≤ 3 µg/kg; other urinary metabolites, like glycolate, urocanate, and 3-hydroxyisovalerate, were only altered at doses that induced moderate to severe steatohepatitis. Bulk liver RNA-seq data suggested altered urinary metabolites correlated with hepatic differential gene expression corresponding to specific metabolic pathways. In addition to evaluating whether altered urinary metabolites were liver-dependent, published single-nuclear RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), AHR ChIP-seq, and AHR knockout gene expression datasets provided further support of hepatic cell-type and AHR-regulated dependency, respectively. Overall, TCDD-induced liver effects were preceded by and occurred with changes in urinary metabolite levels due to AHR-mediated changes in hepatic gene expression.

Each repository emphasizes different aspects regarding data selection and representation, but most offer only limited options for privacy-preserving data sharing. We present MetaboSERV, an open-source, browser-based metabolomics platform dedicated to the selection, integration and sharing of quantitative metabolomics data and metadata with controlled data access. MetaboSERV aims to aid researchers in analyzing their results by facilitating means to browse, visualize and compare data across available data sets. It provides different access control functionalities, creating an environment in which data can be shared safely in a privacy-preserving manner to support collaborative and interdisciplinary research. Furthermore, it is designed to be extensible and adaptable to existing data management infrastructures through the creation of self-managed MetaboSERV instances, for which we provide the source code and a set of pre-built Docker images.

Here, we show that macrophages accumulate within tumors of obese CRC patients and in obese CRC mice and promote accelerated tumor growth. These changes are initiated by oleic acid accumulation and subsequent tumor cell-derived acid production, and driven by signaling through GPR65, an acid-sensing receptor on CRC-associated macrophages. We demonstrate a similar role for GPR65 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in obese mice. Tumors in obese patients with CRC or HCC also exhibit increased GPR65 expression, suggesting that the mechanism revealed here likely contributes to tumor growth in a range of obesity-associated cancers and represents a potential therapeutic target.

L. reuteri can utilize GOS as a carbon resource, providing the foundation for synbiotic development.It is important to identify the intestinal bacteria and metabolites regulated by the synbiotic and then the beneficial effects of identified intestinal bacteria and metabolites will be evaluated in animals with gut inflammation via cytokines detection and metabolomics.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002139	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M84F91			Tissue niche influences immune and metabolic profiles to Staphylococcus aureus biofilm infection	Infection is a devastating post-surgical complication, often requiring additional procedures and prolonged antibiotic therapy. This is especially relevant for craniotomy and prosthetic joint infections (PJI), both of which are characterized by biofilm formation on the bone or implant surface, respectively, with S. aureus representing a primary cause. The local tissue microenvironment likely has profound effects on immune attributes that can influence treatment efficacy, which becomes critical to consider when developing therapeutics for biofilm infections. However, the extent to which distinct tissue niches influence immune function during biofilm development remains relatively unknown. To address this, we compare the metabolomic, transcriptomic, and functional attributes of leukocytes in mouse models of S. aureus craniotomy and PJI complemented with patient samples from both infection modalities, which reveals profound tissue niche-dependent differences in nucleic acid, amino acid, and lipid metabolism with links to immune modulation. These signatures are both spatially and temporally distinct, differing not only between infection sites but evolving over time within a single model. Collectively, this demonstrates that biofilms elicit unique immune and metabolic responses that are heavily influenced by the local tissue microenvironment, which will likely have important implications when designing therapeutic approaches targeting these infections.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002140	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M80R74			Blocking tryptophan catabolism reduces triple-negative breast cancer invasive capacity	Anchorage-independent triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells exhibit elevated levels of the tryptophan (TRP) catabolizing enzyme tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (TDO2) compared to the same cells grown in two-dimensional culture. Tracing of 13C11-TRP demonstrated that anchorage-independent culture and/or inflammatory cytokines that activate nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B (NFκB) increase TRP catabolism and production of downstream catabolites such as kynurenine (KYN), which activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). TDO2 expression is heterogeneous within TNBC cell lines. To determine the function of TDO2, both pharmacologic inhibition and genetic manipulation were conducted. TDO2 knockdown revealed a compensatory increase in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a non-homologous TRP catabolizing enzyme, indicating that dual inhibition of these two enzymes is necessary to reliably block TRP catabolism. Thus, we tested a newly developed TDO2/IDO1 dual inhibitor, AT-0174, and found that it effectively inhibits TNBC TRP catabolism. Furthermore, AT-0174 treatment or AhR inhibitor significantly decreased TNBC anchorage-independent survival, invasive capacity, and expression of mesenchymal genes and protein, while exogenous KYN increased invasion through AhR-mediated ZEB1 expression. Thus, dual inhibition of TDO2/IDO1 may prove efficacious against TNBC progression.

We treated Per1fl/fl or Per1iLKO mice with or without recombinant FGF21 protein after a 14 h + 2 h fast/refeed, and subjected them to heavy isotope metabolic tracing in vivo. Although we observed no significant defects found in total hepatic metabolites involved in glycolysis and PDH-mediated pathway in Per1iLKO mice during refeeding, [13C6]-glucose tracing revealed increased labeling in the glycolytic and PDH-mediated TCA cycle in fasting Per1iLKO mice. Moreover, treatment with recombinant FGF21 significantly reduced glycolytic and PDH-mediated TCA cycle flux in Per1iLKO mice, but did not drive significant changes in fasting Per1fl/fl mice.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002147	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M83F9Q			TREM2 expression level is critical for microglial state, metabolic capacity and efficacy of TREM2 agonism	Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a central regulator of microglial activity and sequence variants are major risk factors for late onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD). To better understand the molecular and functional changes associated with TREM2 signalling, we generated a TREM2 reporter mouse model and observed a gradual upregulation of reporter expression with increasing plaque proximity. Isolated microglia were sorted based on reporter expression and their transcriptomic profiles acquired in both wildtype and APP transgenic animals, allowing us to disentangle TREM2 versus pathology-specific effects. Bulk RNA sequencing highlighted TREM2 level-dependent changes in major immunometabolic pathways, with enrichment of genes in oxidative phosphorylation and cholesterol metabolism in microglia with increased TREM2 expression. To confirm these findings, we next analysed uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and examined metabolomic and lipidomic profiles. Again, independent of Aβ pathology, TREM2 expression correlated with uptake of FDG as well as increased cellular redox, energetics, and cholesterol homeostasis. Finally, we performed chronic treatment with a brain penetrant TREM2 agonist and identified a window of TREM2 expression where microglia are most responsive. Thus, our data provide novel insights into TREM2-mediated regulation of microglial metabolic function and informs current efforts to bring TREM2 agonists into clinical application.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002148	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8ZR7T			Quantifying acyl-chain diversity in isobaric compound lipids containing monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids	To assess whether branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) could be effectively separated and quantified using a C30 liquid chromatography column, we treated 3T3-L1 cells with a variety of lipid substrates, including odd-chain, even-chain, and branched-chain fatty acids. This initial set of experiments aimed to determine whether retention times for compound lipids shifted with the incorporation of different substrates. Despite identical lipid masses, a shift in retention time would indicate that compound lipids with monomethyl branched fatty acids could be separated. Furthermore, we engineered 3T3-L1 cells lacking branched-keto acid dehydrogenase A (Bckdha) and validated our findings using a deuterated BCFA (iso-FA 16:0[D7]). We observed incorporation of this deuterated BCFA into compound lipids, accompanied by a corresponding shift in retention time. Lipid species were analyzed via UHPLC-MS, confirming that the C30 column successfully separated monomethyl BCFA-containing lipids from their straight-chain counterparts.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002150	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8Q82X			Methionine-SAM metabolism-dependent ubiquinone synthesis is crucial for ROS accumulation in ferroptosis induction	Ferroptosis is a cell death modality in which iron-dependent lipid peroxides accumulate on cell membranes. Cysteine, a limiting substrate for the glutathione system that neutralizes lipid peroxidation and prevents ferroptosis, can be converted by cystine reduction or synthesized from methionine. However, accumulating evidence shows methionine-based cysteine synthesis fails to effectively rescue intracellular cysteine levels upon cystine deprivation and is unable to inhibit ferroptosis. Here, we report that methionine-based cysteine synthesis is tissue-specific. Unexpectedly, we find that rather than inhibiting ferroptosis, methionine in fact plays an essential role during cystine deprivation-induced ferroptosis. Methionine-derived S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) contributes to methylation-dependent ubiquinone synthesis, which leads to lipid peroxides accumulation and subsequent ferroptosis. Moreover, SAM supplementation synergizes with imidazole ketone erastin in a tumor growth suppression mouse model. Inhibiting the enzyme that converts methionine to SAM protects heart tissue from doxorubicin-induced and ferroptosis-driven cardiomyopathy. This study broadens our understanding about the intersection of amino acid metabolism and ferroptosis regulation, providing insight into the underlying mechanisms and suggesting the methionine-SAM axis is a promising therapeutic strategy to treat ferroptosis-related diseases.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002151	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8KG00			Uncovering the de novo synthesis of polyamines in gut microbiome using stable isotope resolved metabolomics	Using 13C-inulin as a tracer, we tracked the biosynthesis of polyamines in the human and mouse fecal microbiome. Additionally, single-strain SIRM analyses was used to explore functional gut microbes. Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry analysis revealed distinct 13C enrichment profiles for polyamines. SIRM analyses were performed using a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer, equipped with an Ion Max API source and a HESI II probe, and were coupled to a Dionex UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The findings revealed a novel de novo SPD biosynthesis pathway in the human gut microbiome, and Bacteroides (including B.fragilis and B.thetaiotaomicron) contributed to the biosynthesis of polyamines, underscoring the importance of polyamine bioanalysis in aligning gut microbial functions to host intestinal health.

Leveraging modern high-throughput omics technologies, particularly metabolomics, holds potential to address these challenges.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002153	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M89Z57			A NRF2/β3-adrenoreceptor axis drives a sustained antioxidant and metabolic rewiring through the pentose-phosphate pathway to alleviate cardiac stress	Background Cardiac β3-adrenergic receptors (β3AR) are upregulated in diseased hearts and mediate antithetic effects to those of β1AR and β2AR. β3AR agonists were recently shown to protect from myocardial remodeling in preclinical studies and to improve systolic function in patients with severe heart failure. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain elusive. Methods To dissect functional, transcriptional and metabolic effects, hearts and isolated ventricular myocytes from mice harboring a moderate, cardiac-specific expression of a human ADRB3 transgene (β3AR-Tg) and subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) were assessed using echocardiography, RNAseq, PET scan, metabolomics, seahorse and metabolic flux analysis. Subsequently, signaling and metabolic pathways were investigated further in vivo in β3AR-Tg and in vitro in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes adenovirally infected to express β3AR and subjected to neurohormonal stress. These results were completed with an analysis of single nucleus RNAseq data from human cardiac myocytes from heart failure patients. Results Compared with WT littermate, β3AR-Tg mice were protected from hypertrophy after transaortic constriction (TAC), while systolic function was preserved. β3AR-expressing hearts displayed enhanced myocardial glucose uptake under stress in absence of increased lactate levels. Instead, metabolomic and metabolic flux analyses in stressed hearts revealed an increase in intermediates of the Pentose-Phosphate Pathway (PPP) in β3AR-Tg, an alternative route of glucose utilization, paralleled with increased transcript levels of NADPH-producing and rate-limiting enzymes of the PPP, without fueling the hexosamine metabolism. The ensuing increased content of NADPH and of reduced glutathione decreased myocyte oxidant stress, while downstream oxidative metabolism assessed by oxygen consumption was preserved with higher glucose oxidation in β3AR-Tg post-TAC compared to WT, together with increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Unbiased transcriptomics and pathway analysis identified NRF2 (NFE2L2) as upstream transcription factor which was functionally verified in β3AR-expressing cardiac myocytes where its translocation and nuclear activity was dependent on β3AR activation of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) NO production. Conclusion Moderate expression of cardiac β3AR, at levels observed in human cardiac myocardium, exerts antioxidant effects through activation of the PPP and NRF2 pathway, thereby preserving myocardial oxidative metabolism, function and integrity under pathophysiological stress.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002154	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8681W			Associations Between Maternal Microbiome, Metabolome and Incidence of Low-Birth Weight in Guatemalan Participants from the Women First Trial	Low birth weight (babies born at less than 2,500 grams) affects approximately 15 to 20 percent of global births annually and is associated with poor child development. The goal of this study was to examine relationships between maternal microbial taxa, fecal metabolites, and maternal anthropometry on incidence of LBW in resource-limited settings. This was a secondary analysis of the Women First trial conducted in a semi-rural region of Guatemala. Maternal weight was measured at 12 and 34 weeks (wk) of gestation. Infant anthropometry measures were collected within 48 h of delivery. Maternal fecal samples at 12 and 34 wk were used for microbiome (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) and metabolomics analysis (34 wk only). Linear mixed models using the MaAslin2 package were utilized to assess changes in microbiome associated with LBW. Predictive models using gradient boosted machines (XGBoost) were developed using the H2o.ai engine. No differences in β-diversity were observed at either time point between mothers with LBW infants relative to normal weight (NW) infants. Simpson diversity at 12 and 34 wk was lower in mothers with LBW infants. Notable differences in genus-level abundance between LBW and NW mothers (p&lt; 0.05) were observed at 12 weeks with increasing abundances of Barnesiella, Faecalibacterium, Sutterella, and Bacterioides. At 34 weeks, there were lower abundances of Magasphaera, Phascolarctobacterium, and Turicibacter and higher abundances of Bacteriodes, and Fusobacterium in mothers with LBW infants. Fecal metabolites related to bile acids, tryptophan metabolism and fatty acid related metabolites changed in mothers with LBW infants. Classification models to predict LBW based on maternal anthropometry and predicted microbial functions showed moderate performance. Collectively, the findings indicate that less beneficial gut microbes and circulating metabolites of the mother is associated with low birth weight infants compared to normal weight. Future research should target functional and predictive roles of the maternal gut microbiome in infant birth outcomes including birthweight.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002156	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8XR64			Lipidomic analysis of Malassezia globosa at different growth stages and the dynamics of uptake and secreted lipids with growth media	Malassezia is one of the most abundant genera found on human skin; specifically, M. globosa is one of the yeast species dominant in this organ as it has been associated with several skin diseases. Malassezia cannot synthesize fatty acids. In response, the yeast cell intakes external fatty acids from the host or the growth media for survival. Several studies have focused on investigating the identity of lipids and enzymes in M. globosa to understand its lipid metabolism and the biology of the yeast cell-host interaction. In this work, we performed a supernatant lipidomic analysis on the mDixon media and the supernatant and on the M. globosa at early and late stationary phase (72h and 90h, respectively) to determine the lipid dynamics (lipids consumed vs. lipids secreted) between the growth media and the two stages of growth. We were able to identify 87 lipids within 17 classes of lipids; during the analysis, the increment of several lipids increased throughout time concerning the growth media, suggesting a secretion pattern from the cell to the media; some lipids found in this group were conjugated Sterols (ST) such as Glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), Glycerophospholipids (GP), specifically phosphocholine's (PCs), Cardiolipins (CL), in particular those with chains of (47 to 54 carbons) and Sphingolipids (SP) such as Cer-PI which might have some role in pathogenicity. Likewise, the increment of some lipids decreased, but some only reduced at the late stationary phase (90h) only when the nutrients available was minimal. Finally, we observed a third pattern in which the amount of some lipids decreased throughout time (starting in the early stationary phase and finishing in the late stationary phase), hinting at a distinctive consumption pattern. The principal lipids consumed wereSterols (ST) bile acids, cholic acid, and its derivates, some phosphocholines (PCs), Fatty acyls (FA), and cardiolipins (CL). The consumption of these lipids was associated with different metabolic roles of the lipids in the cell as it lacks production of these lipids in M. globosa.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002159	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8JK0Q			Highly reliable LC-MS lipidomics database for efficient human plasma profiling based on NIST SRM 1950	Liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS)-based methods have become the gold standard methodology for the comprehensive profiling of the human plasma lipidome. However, both the complexity of lipid chemistry and LC-HRMS-associated data pose challenges to the characterization of this biological matrix. In accordance with the current consensus of quality requirements for LC-HRMS lipidomics data, we aimed to characterize the NIST® Standard Reference Material for Human Plasma (SRM 1950) using an LC-ESI(+/–)-MS method compatible with high-throughput lipidome profiling. We generated a highly curated lipid database with increased coverage, quality, and consistency, including additional quality assurance procedures involving adduct formation, within-method m/z evaluation, retention behavior of species within lipid chain isomers, and expert-driven resolution of isomeric and isobaric interferences. As a proof-of-concept, we showed the utility of our in-house LC-MS lipidomic database –consisting of 592 lipid entries– for the fast, comprehensive, and reliable lipidomic profiling of the human plasma from healthy human volunteers. We are confident that the implementation of this robust resource and methodology will have a significant impact by reducing data redundancy and the current delays and bottlenecks in untargeted plasma lipidomic studies.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002160	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8DR6G			Untargeted Metabolomics of 3xTg-AD Neurotoxic Astrocytes	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting approximately 47M people worldwide. Histological features and genetic risk factors, among other evidence, supported the amyloid hypothesis of the disease. This neuronocentric paradigm is currently undergoing a shift, considering evidence of the role of other cell types, such as microglia and astrocytes, in disease progression. Previously, we described a particular astrocyte subtype obtained from the 3xTg-AD murine model that displays neurotoxic properties in vitro. We continue here our exploratory analysis through the lens of metabolomics to identify potentially altered metabolites and biological pathways. Cell extracts from neurotoxic and control astrocytes were compared using HRMS-based metabolomics. Around 12% of metabolic features demonstrated significant differences between neurotoxic and control astrocytes, including alterations in the key metabolite glutamate. Consistent with our previous transcriptomic study, the present results illustrate many homeostatic and regulatory functions of metabolites, suggesting that neurotoxic 3xTg-AD astrocytes exhibit alterations in the Krebs cycle as well as the prostaglandin pathway. This is the first metabolomic study performed in 3xTg-AD neurotoxic astrocytes. These results provide insight into metabolic alterations potentially associated with neurotoxicity and pathology progression in the 3xTg-AD mouse model and strengthen the therapeutic potential of astrocytes in AD.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002161	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M89258			Macrophages are activated towards phagocytic Lymphoma Cell Clearance by Pentose Phosphate Pathway Inhibition	Macrophages in the B-cell lymphoma microenvironment represent a functional node in progression and therapeutic response. We assessed metabolic regulation of macrophages in the context of therapeutic antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) inhibition induced increased phagocytic lymphoma cell clearance by macrophages in vitro, in primary human Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient co-cultures, and in mouse models. Addition of the PPP inhibitor S3 to antibody therapy achieved significantly prolonged overall survival in an aggressive B-cell lymphoma mouse model. PPP inhibition induced metabolic activation and pro-inflammatory polarization of macrophages while it decreased macrophages´ support for survival of lymphoma cells empowering anti-lymphoma function. As mechanism of macrophage repolarization, the link between PPP and immune regulation was identified. PPP inhibition causes decreased glycogen level and subsequent modulation of the immune modulatory UDPG-Stat1-Irg1-Itaconate axis. Thus, we hypothesize the PPP as key regulator and targetable modulator of macrophage activity in lymphoma to improve efficacy of immunotherapies and prolong survival.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002162	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8581K			Cancer-associated fibroblasts maintain critical pancreatic cancer cell lipid homeostasis in the tumor microenvironment	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy with abundant cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) creating hallmark desmoplasia that limits oxygen and nutrient delivery. This study explores the importance of lipid homeostasis under stress. Exogenous unsaturated lipids, rather than de novo synthesis, sustain PDAC cell viability by relieving endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress under nutrient scarcity. Furthermore, CAFs are less hypoxic than adjacent malignant cells in vivo, nominating them as a potential source of unsaturated lipids. CAF conditioned medium promotes PDAC cell survival upon nutrient and oxygen deprivation, an effect reversed by delipidation. Lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) are particularly enriched in CAF conditioned medium and preferentially taken up by PDAC cells, where they are converted to phosphatidylcholine (PC) to sustain membrane integrity. Blocking LPC to PC conversion inhibits PDAC cell survival and increases ER stress. These findings reveal a critical lipid “cross-feeding” mechanism that promotes PDAC cell survival, offering a potential metabolic target for treatment.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002164	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8WR6T			Insulin mitigates acute ischemia induced atrial fibrillation and sinoatrial node dysfunction ex vivo	Acute atrial ischemia is a well-known cause of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF). However, the mechanisms through which ischemia contributes to the development of POAF are not well understood. In this study, ex vivo Langendorff perfusion was employed to induce acute atrial ischemia and reperfusion in the heart, resulting in a temporary form of POAF. The likelihood of atrial fibrillation (AF) was evaluated using programmed electrical stimulation and confirmed through open-atrium optical mapping. Compared to the control group without ischemia, 25 minutes of ischemia significantly increased the incidence of AF. The right atrium was found to be more susceptible to AF than the left atrium. Administering insulin for 30 minutes before ischemia and during reperfusion after 25 minutes of ischemia greatly reduced the vulnerability to AF. Additionally, IC-MS was utilized to assess the effect of insulin on the metabolism of the ischemic and reperfused heart.

https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002166	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8N829			Metabolic Profiling Unveils Enhanced Antibacterial Synergy of Polymyxin B and Teixobactin against Multi-Drug Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii	This untargeted metabolomics study investigated the synergistic antibacterial activity of polymyxin B and Leu10-teixobactin, a depsipeptide inhibitor of cell wall biosynthesis. Checkerboard microdilution assays revealed a significant synergy against polymyxin-susceptible and -resistant A. baumannii, excluding lipopolysaccharide-deficient variants. Time-kill assays confirmed bactericidal synergy, reducing bacterial burden by approximately 4-6-log10CFU/mL. The combination (2xMIC polymyxin B and 0.5xMIC Leu10-teixobactin) prevented bacterial regrowth after 24 h, indicating sustained efficacy against the emergence of resistant mutants. The analysis of A. baumannii ATCCTM 19606 metabolome demonstrated that the polymyxin B–Leu10-teixobactin combination produced more pronounced perturbation compared to the individual antibiotics across all time points (1, 3 and 6 h). Pathway analysis revealed that lipid metabolism, cell envelope biogenesis, and cellular respiration were predominantly impacted by the combination, and to a lesser extent by polymyxin B monotherapy. Leu10-teixobactin treatment alone had only a minor impact on the metabolome, primarily at the 6 h time point. Peptidoglycan assays confirmed the combination’s concerted deleterious effects on bacterial cell envelope integrity. Electron microscopy further substantiated these findings, revealing pronounced cell envelope damage, membrane blebbing, and vacuole formation. These findings highlight the potential of the polymyxin B–Leu10-teixobactin combination as an effective treatment in preventing resistance in A. baumannii.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002170	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M84C19			Combining antibiotics alters the longitudinal maturation of gut microbiota and its short chain fatty acid metabolites in extremely and very preterm infants	Antibiotics are routinely prescribed to extremely and very premature infants as a pre-emptive and prophylactic treatment to reduce the risk of acute neonatal illness (i.e. necrotizing enterocolitis, NEC) associated with morbidity. To investigate the effects of antibiotic types, combinations, and duration on the preterm gut microbiome and metabolome, we analyzed the microbiome compositions of 123 stool samples collected at 3 timepoints (postnatal day 1, 28 and 56) from extremely- and very-low-birthweight infants treated with 14 different antibiotics spanning across 5 classes. Targeted metabolomics were performed on 47 samples available, allowing us to quantify 649 metabolites including amino acids, bile acids, fatty acids, and lipids. As a result, we found that antibiotics exerted the most profound disruptive impact on the gut microbiota, while antibiotics and breastfeeding highly influence the gut metabolome. Short chain fatty acids were reduced in both antibiotic-treated and NEC group. Finally, we revealed that cephalosporins negatively impact conjugated bile acids due to a positive correlation with bile salt hydrolase-producing Staphylococcus.

To determine the changes in lipid composition of the SART1-deficient livers compared to age-matched wild- type livers, we performed lipidomics profiling of livers from mice of different ages. Flash-frozen livers from male Alb-Cre +/- SART1 +/+ (control) and Alb-Cre +/- SART-/- (KO) were subjected to lipidomics profiling. The following groups were used: Age 6 months: Control liver(5 mice), KO liver (5 mice) Age 12 months: Control liver (5 mice), KO liver (5 mice) Age 18 months: Control liver (5 mice), KO liver tumors (3 mice)
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002172	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8VV6J			Microbiome and metabolome association network analysis identifies Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and Paraprevotella as putative keystone genera in the gut of common marmosets	The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a nonhuman primate species, is a model organism that has garnered interest in recent years for its potential translational value in a variety of research settings including the field of microbiomics. While the composition of the marmoset’s gut microbiome has been described in captivity, little is known about how gut microbiota interact with each other over time and how they relate to metabolite productions. To help answer this, we characterized interactions in the gut microbiome of the common marmoset by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient between 16S rDNA-derived relative genera abundance data and targeted metabolomics data collected longitudinally from 10 marmosets (6 males and 4 females). Association network graphs were used to visualize significant correlations and identify genera and metabolites that exhibit a high degree of associations, marking them as more influential within the microbiome. Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, among the highest-degree genera for bacterial and metabololomic associations, also had a high relative betweenness centrality and negatively associated with high-degree Paraprevotella, indicating that it potentially plays a gatekeeping role within the bacteria-bacteria interaction and communication network. Corresponding metabolites with more numerous bacterial associations, including bile acids and taurine, are known regulators of bacterial growth that provide a potential mechanism through which Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and others exert their influence. To further characterize microbiome interactions, we performed hierarchical clustering on significant within-dataset associations and developed a new “Keystone Candidate Score” metric that identified Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and Paraprevotella as the most influential bacteria (so-called candidate keystone genera) in the marmoset gut microbiome.

Recently, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B or P27KIP1) 1 has been reported as a non-canonical inhibitor to mTOR signaling in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). However, the mechanisms underlying P27KIP1-mTOR axis are yet-to-be uncovered. Here, we find that micropeptide human small regulatory polypeptide of amino acid response (hSPAR）, through its C-terminus (hSPAR-C), inhibits E3 ligase tripartite motif containing 21 (TRIM21)-mediated P27KIP1 degradation and causes P27KIP1’s cytoplasmic accumulation in breast cancer cells. Interestingly, hSPAR/hSPAR-C also serves as an inhibitor to glutamine transporter SLC38A2 and remarkably decreases the cellular glutamine level specifically in cancer cells. The resulted glutamine deprivation sequentially triggers translocation of cytoplasmic P27KIP1 to lysosomes, where P27KIP1 disrupts Ragulator complex and suppresses mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) assembly. Administration of hSPAR or hSPAR-C dramatically impedes breast cancer cell proliferation and xenografic tumor growth. Collectively, we define hSPAR as an intrinsic molecule to control cellular glutamine level and a previously-unidentified tumor suppressor by promoting accumulation and lysosomal-localization of P27KIP1 to inhibit mTORC1 assembly.

Nonetheless, the regulatory mechanism of hyperaccumulator biological nitrogen fixation has remained elusive. Here, we report the mechanism by which arsenic regulates biological nitrogen fixation in the arsenic-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata. Field investigations and greenhouse experiments, based on multi-omics approaches, reveal that elevated arsenic stress induces an enrichment of key diazotrophs, enhances plant nitrogen acquisition, and thus improves plant growth. Metabolomic analysis and microfluidic experiments further demonstrate that the upregulation of specific root metabolites plays a crucial role in recruiting key diazotrophic bacteria. These findings highlight the pivotal role of nitrogen-acquisition mechanisms in the arsenic hyperaccumulation of Pteris vittata, and provide valuable insights into the plant stress resistance.

These results provide a new framework for understanding the interaction between soybean and SCN.

Study Design: This case-control study included 20 women undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF), comparing 10 women diagnosed with UI to 10 control women whose male partners had abnormal semen parameters. FF samples were collected during oocyte retrieval and analysed using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and reversed-phase liquid chromatography, coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) on a Q-TOF mass spectrometer. Metabolites were identified using XCMS Online and MetaboAnalyst, followed by pathway enrichment analysis via the KEGG database. Statistical analyses including OPLS-DA and ROC analysis assessed their diagnostic potential. Metabolite levels were correlated with clinical parameters, including embryo development rates, oocyte maturation, and IVF outcomes. Results: In women with UI, 12 metabolites, including Diacylglycerols, Phosphatidic acids, Vitamin D3 glucosiduronate, 1α-hydroxy-2β-(5-hydroxypentoxy) vitamin D3, Asparginyl-Asparagine, Lithocholic acid, Leu-Pro-Ala-Ser-Phe, Triacylglycerols, Phosphatidyl choline, Phosphatidylethanolamine and Lactosyl ceramide were significantly decreased, while Ile-Lys-Val-Val was significantly increased compared to controls. These metabolites were linked to glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, and steroid synthesis pathways. PLS-DA, OPLS-DA, and ROC analysis indicated high diagnostic performance, with AUC values exceeding 0.8. Additionally, Vitamin D3 glucosiduronate levels negatively correlated with embryo development rates, while Asparginyl-Asparagine levels demonstrated a positive correlation with the MII oocyte rate. Conclusion: This study constitutes the first comprehensive characterization of metabolic dysregulation in the FF of women with UI, offering novel insights into the underlying mechanisms contributing to this condition and advocates for routine assessment of vitamin D3 levels in serum/FF of these women.

Pasture samples (n=13) were obtained from the three grass-fed farms, while total mixed ration (TMR) samples (n=4) were collected from the grain-fed feedlot. Four beef samples were collected from each of the three grass-fed farms and from the grain-fed feedlot, providing a comprehensive comparison of metabolomic differences influenced by distinct feed types and finishing systems.

Cancer cells in acidic tumor regions exhibit a shift from glucose metabolism to the preferential uptake and use of fatty accids. This project aims to analyse the fate of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, an omega-3 polysunsaturated fatty acid) in cancer cells maintained at physiological pH (7.4) or adpated to an acidic pH (6.5). The accumulation of triglycerides and phospholipids was analysed together with changes in the proportion of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002184	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M89V56			Restricting lysine normalizes toxic catabolites associated with ALDH7A1-deficiency in cells and mice	Lysine metabolism converges at α-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH7A1). Rare loss-of-function mutations in ALDH7A1 cause a toxic accumulation of lysine catabolites, including piperideine 6-carboxylate (P6C), that are thought to cause fatal seizures in children unless strictly managed with dietary lysine reduction. In this study, we perform metabolomics and expression analysis of tissues from Aldh7a1-deficient mice, which reveal tissue-specific differences in lysine metabolism and other metabolic pathways. We also develop a fluorescent biosensor to characterize lysine transporter activity and identify competitive substrates that reduce the accumulation of lysine catabolites in ALDH7A1-deficient HEK293 cells. Lastly, we show that intravenous administration of lysine α-oxidase from Trichoderma viride reduces lysine and P6C levels by &gt;80% in mice. Our results improve our understanding of lysine metabolism and make inroads towards improving therapeutic strategies for lysine catabolic disorders.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002185	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M86527			Metabolomics analysis of tissues isolated from Aldh7a1+/+ and Aldh7a1-/- (KO) mice.	ALDH7A1 is an enzyme involved in the catabolism of lysine. Using Aldh7a1-knockout (-/-) and wild-type (+/+) mice and metabolomics, we aim to determine how Aldh7a1-deficiency leads to the accumulation of lysine catabolites upstream of ALDH7A1 and affects other metabolic pathways. Our results suggest that there is a tissue-specific accumulation of lysine and other metabolites, with the brain exhibiting the largest number of significantly different metabolites.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002186	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M82B9C			Stable-isotope lysine tracing to differentiate utilization of the saccharopine and/or pipecolate pathways in HEK293 cells and primary mouse astrocytes.	L-lysine (Lysine) is an essential proteinogenic amino acid that is acquired from a protein-rich diet. Lysine is metabolized to fuel acyl-CoA and L-carnitine synthesis in cells and tissues. The two main catabolic pathways, named after their products pipecolate or saccharopine, differ in their cytosolic or mitochondrial localization, respectively, but converge at the mitochondrial enzyme α-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH7A1, or antiquitin). To differentiate between the utilization of these two pathways, we cultured HEK293 cells or primary mouse astrocytes with unlabeled L-lysine, 13C6-L-lysine, alpha-15N-L-lysine, or epsilon-15N-L-lysine for 24 hours and analyzed atom incorporation into downstream metabolites using LCMS. Our results suggest that both cell types exclusively use the saccharopine pathway. In addition, we show that pipecolate can be generated from interconversion of piperideine 6-carboxylate rather than from activity of the pipecolate pathway, which was silent in both cell types.

N-methyl-arginine inhibits the uptake and metabolism of lysine and arginine by competing for similar transporters. In this project, we aimed to determine the cellular effects of N-methyl-arginine using metabolomics by treating HEK293 control (sgTom) or ALDH7A1-KO (sgALDH7A1) cells for 20-24 hours. N-methyl-arginine treatment significantly reduced the levels of arginine, lysine, saccharopine, aminoadipate, piperideine 6-carboxylate, and pipecolate in a dose-dependent manner.

In this study, to investigate these molecular changes and thus better understand their contribution to behavioural responses and modulation, we analysed the global metabolomic shifts in honeybee workers and their microbiota throughout their lives. Overall, our findings provide new insights toward developing potential biomarkers for evaluation of different functional changes related to various environmental stressors.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002190	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8JB9Q			N-methyl-arginine significantly inhibits net arginine uptake flux in HEK293 cells in a dose-dependent manner.	N-methyl-arginine inhibits the metabolism of lysine and arginine by competing for similar transporters. In this project, we aimed to determine the effects of N-methyl-arginine on amino acid uptake flux in HEK293 cells treated for 20-24 hours. N-methyl-arginine supplementation inhibited the net uptake of arginine but did not significantly affect lysine or other amino acid uptake fluxes.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002191	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8DN9K			N-methyl-arginine is taken up into the liver, brain, and kidney of mice.	N-methyl-arginine was identified as a transported substrate through multiple cationic amino acid transporters, which facilitate the uptake of lysine, arginine, and other structurally related amino acids. In cell culture, N-methyl-arginine inhibits the uptake and metabolism of lysine. In this project, we aimed to determine if N-methyl-arginine administered to mice at 80 mg/kg was sufficient to inhibit tissue lysine uptake and metabolism. Following a single injection, N-methyl-arginine significantly accumulated in mouse plasma and tissues but failed to significantly inhibit the level of lysine metabolites (e.g., saccharopine). These results are in-line with in vitro results suggesting that N-methyl-arginine is a relatively low affinity transport inhibitor.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002192	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M88V5W			N-methyl-arginine uptake by HEK293 cells is inhibited by cationic amino acids.	N-methyl-arginine is a transported substrate and inhibitor of lysine uptake in cells. In this project, we aimed to determine whether N-methyl-arginine uptake is inhibited by cationic and/or neutral amino acid transporters by co-treating cells with N-methyl-arginine and one of the following amino acids: D-lysine, L-lysine, L-ornithine, L-leucine, L-alanine, or L-arginine. N-methyl-arginine uptake was inhibited by all cationic amino acids and L-leucine but not L-alanine. To determine whether the SLC7 family of transporter(s) are necessary for N-methyl-arginine transport, we also pre-treated cells with the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) prior to supplementing N-methyl-arginine. SLC7 transporters have a conserved reduced thiol that resides within the binding pocket and is sensitive to NEM alkylation. N-methyl-arginine uptake was not significantly affected by NEM pre-treatment, suggesting that transport is through multiple cationic amino acid transporters.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002193	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8554P			Knockdown of SLC7A1, SLC7A2, or SLC7A6 affects cationic amino acid levels but not N-methyl-arginine uptake in HEK293 cells.	N-methyl-arginine is a cationic amino acid transporter inhibitor that restricts the uptake and metabolism of lysine. Towards understanding how specific cationic amino acid transporters influence lysine and arginine uptake, we performed knockdown studies targeting SLC7A1 (CAT1), SLC7A2 (CAT2), or SLC7A6 (y+LAT2) and performed metabolomics and N-methyl-arginine uptake assays. Our results suggest that CAT1 and CAT2 facilitate the import of lysine, whereas y+LAT2 facilitates cellular secretion in exchange for a neutral amino acid. N-methyl-arginine uptake was not significantly affected by knockdown of any single transporter, suggesting that it is taken up by multiple cationic amino acid transporters simultaneously.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002194	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M81C1C			Poplar leaf bud resin metabolomics: Seasonal profiling of leaf bud chemistry in Populus trichocarpa provides insight into resin biosynthesis	Trees in the genus Populus synthesize sticky and fragrant resins to protect dormant leaf buds during winter. These resins contain diverse phenolic metabolites, in particular hydroxycinnamate esters and methylated flavonoids. P. trichocarpa leaf bud resin is characterized by methylated dihydrochalcone aglycones. To determine how the resin profile is influenced by seasonal changes, P. trichocarpa lateral leaf bud extracts (Total_resin_positive_mode.txt) and secreted surface resin (Surface_resin_positive_mode.txt) were collected monthly over a one-year cycle. The dihydrochalcones in both sets of extracts were quantified using UPLC-MS and other chemical changes monitored using nontargeted metabolomics by UPLC-HRMS. The results indicate that the dihydrochalcone content changes over the seasons and that biosynthesis occurs concomitant with bud development in the summer months. Non-targeted metabolomics data confirmed a pattern of dramatic changes in the summer, and further suggested additional periods of substantive biochemical change in the resin. While overall patterns of surface-extracted resin matched that of whole bud extracts, some of the dynamics were shifted in the surface resin samples. This study provides the basis for the use of dihydrochalcones and other identified resin components as metabolic markers for more detailed investigations of resin biosynthesis, secretion and movement to the bud surface.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002196	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8RV6M			Multiple, redundant carboxylic acid transporters support mitochondrial metabolism in Plasmodium falciparum	The mitochondrion of the deadliest human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, is an essential source of cellular acetyl-CoA during the asexual blood-stage of the parasite life cycle. Indeed, blocking mitochondrial acetyl-CoA synthesis leads to a hypoacetylated proteome and parasite death. We previously determined that mitochondrial acetyl-CoA is primarily synthesized from glucose-derived pyruvate by α-ketoacid dehydrogenases. Here, we asked if inhibiting the import of glycolytic pyruvate across the mitochondrial inner membrane would affect acetyl-CoA production and, thus, could be a potential target for novel antimalarial drug development. We selected the two predicted mitochondrial pyruvate carrier proteins (MPC1 and MPC2) for genetic knockout and isotopic metabolite tracing via HPLC-MS metabolomic analysis. Surprisingly, we observed that asexual blood-stage parasites could survive the loss of either or both proteins with only minor asexual blood-stage growth defects, despite a substantial reduction in the amount of glucose-derived isotopic labelling into acetyl-CoA. Furthermore, genetic deletion of two additional mitochondrial carboxylic acid transporters – DTC (di/tricarboxylic acid carrier) and YHM2 (a putative citrate/α-ketoglutarate carrier protein) – only mildly affected asexual blood-stage replication, even in the context of MPC-deficiency. Although we observed no added impact on the incorporation of glucose carbon into acetyl-CoA in these quadruple knockout mutants, we noted a large decrease in glutamine-derived label in tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites, suggesting that DTC and YHM2 both import glutamine derivatives into the mitochondrion. Altogether, our results expose redundant routes used to fuel the mitochondria of blood-stage malaria parasites with imported carbon from two major carbon sources – glucose and glutamine.

However, climate change poses significant challenges to seed quality due to abiotic stressors, such as drought and elevated temperatures. These stresses affect not only the seeds themselves but also the environmental conditions in which mother plants develop, leading to broader impacts on seed quality and crop resilience. In this study, we examine metabolic changes in the seeds of malting barley, where mother plants were exposed to drought or elevated temperature conditions. By analyzing seeds from these stressed plants, we aim to reveal how environmental conditions experienced by the mother plant influence seed metabolism and performance. Our comprehensive approach provides a solid foundation for understanding how seeds respond to environmental variations passed down through their progeny.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002198	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8HC23			Metabolomics of Papanicolaou Tests for the Discovery of Ovarian Cancer Biomarkers	Ovarian cancer (OC) remains one of the most lethal cancers among female populations due to the vast majority of cases going undiagnosed until later stages (stage III, IV). Early detection and treatment of this malignancy provides the best prognosis, but the lack of accurate and sensitive screening tools combined with the presence of ambiguous symptoms hinders these diagnoses. In contrast, screening for cervical cancer via Papanicolaou (Pap) tests is a widespread practice with use spanning the past several decades, reducing this cancer’s morbidity and mortality rates. Two types of Pap smear tests exist: a conventional method where cells from the ectocervix are stained on a glass slide and a liquid-based cytology method. Interestingly, previous studies show evidence of OC cells in Pap tests, suggesting that lipids shed from ovarian tumors may end up in the cervix. The goal of this study is to evaluate the practicality of using liquid-based Pap tests as biospecimens for OC screening-related metabolic studies. Cell pellets from liquid-based Pap tests from 29 healthy women were analyzed via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). This approach facilitated the detection and annotation of 453 unique lipids across 20 lipid subclasses, including ceramides, triacylglycerols, and hexosylceramides. These results demonstrated the feasibility of using an MS-based approach to analyze residual Pap test samples for the discovery of OC-related lipid biomarkers with the goal of detecting OC at early stages of the disease.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002199	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8CN7H			Optimization and characterization of N-acetamide indoles as antimalarials that target the Plasmodium falciparum protein, PfATP4	Emerging resistance to frontline antimalarials is resulting in them becoming increasingly ineffective, highlighting the need for new antimalarials. To discover new antimalarials a screen of the Janssen Jumpstarter library against the asexual stage parasite uncovered an N-acetamide indole hit class. The structure-activity relationship of this chemotype was defined by generating optimized frontrunner analogs including WJM664 with potent asexual stage activity and high metabolic stability. To determine the mechanism of action, resistance was selected and whole genome sequencing revealed mutations in PfATP4. PfATP4 was validated as the target of the N-acetamide indole class showing cross-resistance to PfATP4 drug-resistant strains, and a metabolomic signature consistent with the PfATP4 inhibitor KAE609. The indole acetamide class exhibited a fast-to-moderate rate of kill and a vacuolized asexual blood stage phenotype, phenocopying known PfATP4 inhibitors. Moreover, N-acetamide indole analogs increased cytosolic Na+ demonstrating on-target inhibition of PfATP4. N-Acetamide indole derivatives inhibited male and female gamete development and blocked transmission from infected blood to the mosquito. WJM664 exhibited low oral efficacy in an asexual stage P. berghei mouse model which may be attributed to the low potency against PbATP4, and the low aqueous solubility and Caco-2 permeability. Further optimization of these attributes is required for the N-acetamide indole class to be considered for development in a curative or transmission blocking combination therapy.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002200	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M87Z47			Unraveling cysteine deficiency-associated rapid weight loss	Forty percent of the US population and 1 in 6 individuals worldwide are obese, with the incidence surging globally. Various dietary interventions, including carbohydrate, fat and more recently amino acid restriction, have been explored to combat this epidemic. We investigated the impact of removing individual amino acids on the weight profiles of mice. Here, we show that conditional cysteine restriction resulted in the most dramatic weight loss when compared to essential amino acid restriction, amounting to 30% within one week, which was readily reversed. We found that cysteine deficiency activated the integrated stress response and oxidative stress response, which amplify each other, leading to the induction of GDF15 and FGF21, which partly explained the phenotype. Surprisingly, we observed lower tissue coenzyme A (CoA), which has been considered to be extremely stable10, resulting in reduced mitochondrial functionality and metabolic rewiring. This results in energetically inefficient anaerobic glycolysis and defective TCA cycle, with sustained urinary excretion of pyruvate, orotate, citrate, α-ketoglutarate, nitrogen rich compounds, and amino acids In summary, our investigation reveals that cysteine restriction, by depleting GSH and CoA, exerts a maximal impact on weight loss, metabolism, and stress signaling compared to other amino acid restrictions. These findings suggest novel strategies for addressing a range of metabolic diseases and the growing obesity crisis.

Many lipid metabolism genes, male sterility (GMS) genes play a role in the endoplasmic reticulum of anther tapetum, but little is known about GMS genes involved in the de novo synthesis of fatty acids in anther tapetum. Using gene mapping, we cloned a new GMS gene, enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (ZmENR1). enr1 (mutation of enoyl-ACP reductase gene) has early tapetum degradation, anther epidermis and pollen exine defects. In order to further study the function of ZmENR1, we compared the changes of lipid content in anthers of wild-type (WT) and enr1 mutants at maturity. The expression of ZmENR1 significantly affected the contents of cutin, wax and total fatty acids (TFA) in anthers. In addition, enr1 mutant reduced the expression of cutin/wax and sporopollen related genes to inhibit the formation of anther epidermis and pollen exine. Therefore, our researches provide a new insight into the synthesis of fatty acids mediated by ZmENR1, and provide an insight into the molecular mechanism of ZmENR1 regulating maize male sterility.

High mobility group A1 (HMGA1) is a structural transcription factor and frequently overexpressed in human colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we show that HMGA1 promotes CRC progression by driving lipid synthesis in a AOM/DSS-induced CRC mouse model. Using conditional knockout (Hmga1△IEC) and knock-in (Hmga1IEC-OE/+) mouse models, we demonstrate that HMGA1 enhances CRC cell proliferation and accelerates tumor development by upregulating fatty acid synthase (FASN). Mechanistically, HMGA1 increases the transcriptional activity of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) on the FASN promoter, leading to increased lipid accumulation in intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, a high-fat diet exacerbates CRC progression in Hmga1△IEC mice, while pharmacological inhibition of FASN by orlistat reduces tumor growth in Hmga1IEC-OE/+ mice. Our findings suggest that targeting lipid metabolism could offer a promising therapeutic strategy for CRC.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002203	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8VN7V			Dietary fructose enhances tumor growth indirectly via interorgan lipid transfer	Fructose consumption has increased considerably over the past five decades, largely due to the widespread use of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) as a sweetener. It has been proposed that fructose promotes the growth of some tumors by serving as a direct fuel. Here, we show that fructose supplementation enhances tumor growth in animal models of melanoma, breast cancer, and cervical cancer without causing weight gain or insulin resistance. Interestingly, the cancer cells themselves were unable to use fructose readily as a nutrient because they did not express ketohexokinase-C (KHK-C). Primary hepatocytes did express KHK-C, resulting in fructolysis and the excretion of a variety of lipid species, including lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). In co-culture experiments, hepatocyte-derived LPCs were consumed by cancer cells and used to generate phosphatidylcholines (PCs), the major phospholipid of cell membranes. In vivo, HFCS supplementation increased several LPC species by &gt;7-fold in serum. Administration of LPCs to mice was sufficient to increase tumor growth. Pharmacological inhibition of ketohexokinase had no direct effect on cancer cells, but it decreased circulating LPC levels and prevented fructose-mediated tumor growth in vivo. These findings reveal that fructose supplementation increases circulating nutrients such as LPCs, which can enhance tumor growth through a cell non-autonomous mechanism.

These heart complications are the leading cause of death in people with diabetes. People with diabetes develop heart failure without other common risk factors like high blood pressure or coronary heart disease. This condition is known as ‘diabetic cardiomyopathy’. Unfortunately, the exact causes of diabetes-induced heart failure in people with T1D are not fully understood. Given the lack of effective treatment for diabetic cardiomyopathy, the discovery of clear diagnostic lipid biomarkers from preclinical models of T1D could be key to managing disease progression.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002206	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8GG1F			Comparison of the capillary and venous blood lipidomes- validation of the Tasso SST capillary blood collection device for circulating lipid biomarker analysis	Cumulative evidence identifies many circulating lipids can act as biomarkers of human health and status. To date, lipid biomarkers have largely been correlated to dietary patterns to reveal the beneficial effects of specific nutritional regimens and at the same time, for screening, early diagnosis, and therapeutic decision making in cardio-metabolic diseases, and in certain types of cancers. These studies use biofluids or tissues as a source of material for lipidomics. Blood is a readily accessible and most commonly analyzed biological fluid not only for plasma/serum based lipidomics studies but also for laboratory based multi-analyte panels (enzyme, metabolite, electrolyte, lipid, hormone, or vitamin levels) and biomarkers for diseases. Therefore, collection of high-quality volumetric blood for these purposes is important as composition of blood provides a wealth of reliable information concerning a patient’s health. Venipuncture is the clinical gold standard for blood collection, however, recently a single-use, clinical-grade, automatic at-home capillary blood collecting device called Tasso+ (formely called TassoOne™ hemolink) (https://www.tassoinc.com) has been introduced in both educational and healthcare institutions. A few studies have already reported the use of Tasso+ in clinical and non-clinical settings and have also been assessed for clinical chemistry hematology, and serology with overall good analytical performance and participant acceptance, there are still no studies in literatures evaluating the suitability of Tasso-based collected blood for lipidomics. Therefore, the aim of this pilot study was to establish and validate the suitability of Tasso+-drawn blood plasma as an alternative to venous blood plasma for clinical lipidomics. For this purpose, blood was collected from healthy (non-fasting) consenting adults (n =10, age = &gt;18 years old) under an approved IRB protocol at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Subjects provided written consent to participate in the study and provided matched blood using traditional venipuncture and TASSO+ device. Comprehensive plasma lipidomics analysis of blood samples collected through venipuncture and Tasso+ devices was carried out to investigate and compare the performance and suitability of Tasso+ devices for lipidomics. Plasma was extracted from the respective venous and capillary blood samples and prepared for the global lipidomics on LC-MS coupled online via an ESI with a Q Exactive™ MS instrument. The lipidomics data was processed using MS-DIAL v. 4.9.221218 software and only lipids with MS2 level identification was used for statistical analyses. comprehensive statistical analysis with cross validation and multiple testing adjustments show that the lipid composition of paired Tasso+ and venous blood samples do not significantly differ (adjusted p-value &gt; 0.05). A linear regression model with Spearman correlation analysis also showed a significant-to-perfect level (r = 0.95-0.99) of concordance between the matched samples. With the exception of monoacylglycerols (MG) and cardiolipins (CL), every class of lipid biomarkers also demonstrated substantially high degree of correlation (0.9-0.99) between paired venous and capillary blood. These findings demonstrate that capillary and venous blood plasma lipidomes are similar; indicating that self-administered capillary sampling could be used interchangeably with standardized venipuncture in clinical research settings.

Mechanistic insight into drivers of the NRF2 dependency remains poorly understood. Here, we defined a novel NRF2 target gene set linked to NRF2-dependency in cancer cell lines, and observed that a significant portion of these genes is devoid of promoter-proximal NRF2. Using integrated genomic analyses, we characterized extensive NRF2-dependent enhancer RNA (eRNA) synthesis and NRF2-mediated H3K27ac deposition at proximal and distal enhancer regions regulating these genes. While CBP/p300 is a well-validated direct interaction partner of NRF2 with prominent functions at enhancers, we report that this interaction is not required for NRF2-dependent NSCLC cell growth, indicating that NRF2 can sustain sufficient transcriptional activity in the absence of CBP/p300 coactivation. Broad metabolic profiling established a primary role for CBP/p300 in NRF2-dependent accumulation of glutathione and glutathione-related metabolites. While redox homeostasis via enhanced glutathione production is commonly associated with the normal physiological role of NRF2, collectively our results suggest that NRF2-dependent cancer cell growth does not require this enhanced glutathione production.

Dysregulated cellular metabolism has been shown to participate in several pathologic processes, however, its role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis remains largely unknown. In this study, we used mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and global metabolomics to examine the metabolites differences in control mouse lungs and fibrotic mouse lungs. This metabolomic profiling provides further insights into the pathogenesis of pulmonary injury and fibrosis.

However, the impact of systemic metabolism and diet on tumour evolution is less understood. This study delves into the role of glucagon in the regulation of cancer cell features and the metabolic remodelling in the presence and absence of glucose, in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs). To fulfil the experiments pNET cell lines (BON-1 and QGP-1) and non-malignant pancreatic α-TC1 cell line were used as models. Results showed that pNET cells responded differently to glucose deprivation than α-TC1 cells. Specifically, pNET cells upregulated GCGR in the absence of glucose, while α-TC1 cells did so in high-glucose conditions. Glucagon activated the MAPK/ERK pathway, especially in pNET cells without glucose and α-TC1 cells with high glucose conditions. Glucagon enhanced metabolic viability, proliferation, and migration in pNET cells under glucose-deprived conditions and hyperglucagonaemia. Meanwhile, in α-TC1 cell line, glucagon modulated these features under high-glucose conditions and physiological glucagon levels. Metabolic analysis using NMR revealed differences in amino acid levels and metabolic processes based on glucose availability between cell lines. Furthermore, gene expression analysis showed that glucose conditions largely influenced gene expression patterns in both pNETs and α-TC1. Interestingly, QGP-1 and α-TC1 produced glucose in no-glucose conditions, and glucagon upregulated glucose production in α-TC1. Hence gluconeogenesis may be beneficial for some pNET subsets, and it may open new perspectives to novel metabolism-based strategies to clinically manage pNETs. Furthermore, the production of glucose by α-cells was not described so far and is a step forward in endocrinology and systemic metabolism. Lastly, an association between GCGR expression and malignancy was observed, despite the decreased expression in tumours comparing with the normal tissue. A negative correlation between GCGR and GLP-1R expression was observed, highlighting the putative biological role of glucagon in pNETs malignancy.

Glutamine plays a key role in CNS physiology, and metabolic adjustments have been reported in GBM, which are considered glutamine-addicted. Therefore, our goal was to affect GBM cells by decreasing the systemic bioavailability of glutamine with a glutaminase (GLS1)-based therapy. The in vitro results showed that the GBM cell lines were indeed glutamine-dependent, triggering a metabolic remodeling upon the presence/absence of glutamine. GLS1 treatment increased cell death, decreased cell proliferation, and induced U-87MG invasion, due to glutamine scarcity. This intervention triggered a metabolic shift, evident in altered gene expression and metabolite profiles in cell extracts and conditioned media. Results from the in vivo orthotopic xenograft mouse model of GBM showed an increase in overall survival (OS) with the GLS1 treatment, along with lower cachexia. Moreover, metabolomics’ multivariate analysis of serum collected during tumor induction and the therapeutic course showed statistically different metabolic profiles of GLS1-treated mice midst treatment, which could help monitor the therapy response.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002216	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85Z4M			Metabolomics of the liver after administration of adenovirus associated with metabolic liver zonation	Metabolic zonation in the liver is broadly defined as spatiotemporal variability in the intra-hepatic distribution of nutrients. R-spondin3 (Rspo3) regulates metabolic features around hepatic central veins. Herein, we demonstrate that altered hepatic metabolic zonation due to Rspo3 contributes to maintaining systemic glucose metabolism and body composition via inter-organ communication mechanism. Hepatic Rspo3 induction in obesity improves obesity-associated features by restoring insulin sensitivity, reversing adipose tissue enlargement and reversing overstimulated adaptive thermogenesis. These remote effects partly consist of neuronal communication via the afferent vagus from the liver. In contrast, hepatic Rspo3 suppression exacerbates diabetes due to insulin resistance and develops fatty liver.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002217	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M82821			Metabolomic-Based Clinical Assessment of Preterm Birth	Machine learning (ML), with advancements in algorithms and computations, is seeing an increased presence in life science research. This study investigated several ML models' efficacy in predicting preterm birth using untargeted metabolomics from serum collected during the third trimester of gestation. Samples from 48 preterm and 102 term delivery mothers (1:2 ratio) from the All Our Families Cohort (Calgary, AB) were examined. Selected ML applications were used to examine the small-scale clinical dataset for both model performance and metabolite interpretation. Model performance was evaluated based on confusion matrices, receiver operating characteristic curves, and feature importance rankings. Conventional linear models, like Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and linear logistic regression, showed moderate predictive potential with AUC-ROC around 0.60. Non-linear models, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and artificial neural networks, had marginally improved predictive accuracy and strength. Resampling by bootstrapping was also examined. Among all MLs, bootstrap resampling enhanced XGBoost's performance the most, improving AUC-ROC (0.85, 95% CI:0.574-0.995, p&lt;0.001) for the best fitted model. Feature importance analysis by Shapley Additive Explanations analysis consistently identified acylcarnitines and amino acid derivatives as significant metabolites. Findings underscored the complexity of modeling preterm birth prediction, suggesting a trial-and-error approach for model selection.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002218	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8XF95			Mitochondria complex III is essential for IL-10 secretion in macrophages independent of respiration	Mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) function is linked to macrophage function. However, mechanisms underlying mitochondrial ETC control of macrophage immune responses are not fully understood. We used genetic tools to examine the necessity of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC)-dependent respiration and the production of reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in macrophage immune responses. Here we report that mitochondrial ETC complex III (CIII)-deficient mouse macrophages, which have impaired macrophage respiration and mtROS production, exhibit increased susceptibility to influenza A virus and LPS-induced endotoxic shock. Mitochondrial CIII-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) produced IL-10 but exhibit dampened release following TLR3 or TLR4 stimulation in vitro. Surprisingly, restoring mitochondrial respiration without generating mtROS in mitochondrial CIII-deficient macrophages with Ciona intestinalis alternative oxidase (AOX) is not sufficient to reverse the increased vulnerability to LPS-induced endotoxic shock or rescue IL-10 release in vitro. However, activation of PKA, an mtROS-responsive pathway2, was sufficient to rescue BMDM IL-10 release following LPS stimulation. Additionally, mitochondrial CIII impairment in macrophages does not affect canonical responses to interleukin-4 (IL-4) stimulation. Thus, our results highlight necessity of mitochondrial ROS but not respiration in release of IL-10.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002219	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8SR8N			Biotin rescues manganese-induced parkinson's disease phenotypes and neurotoxicity	Occupational exposure to manganese (Mn) induces manganism and has been widely linked as a contributing environmental factor to Parkinson's disease (PD), featuring dramatic signature overlaps between the two in motor symptoms and clinical hallmarks. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this link remains elusive, and for combating PD, effective mechanism-based therapies are lacking. Here, we developed an adult Drosophila model of Mn toxicity to recapitulate key Parkinsonian features, spanning behavioral deficits, neuronal loss, and dysfunctions in lysosomes and mitochondria. We performed global metabolomics on flies at an early toxicity stage and identified metabolism of the B vitamin, biotin (vitamin B7), as a master pathway underpinning Mn toxicity with systemic, body–brain increases in Mn-treated groups compared to the controls. Using BtndRNAi mutant flies, we show that biotin depletion exacerbates Mn-induced neurotoxicity, Parkinsonism, and mitochondrial dysfunction, while in Mn-exposed wildtype flies, biotin feeding dramatically ameliorates these pathophenotypes. We further show in human induced stem cells (iPSCs)-differentiated midbrain dopaminergic neurons that the supplemented biotin protects against Mn-induced neuronal loss, cytotoxicity, and mitochondrial dysregulation. Finally, human data profiling biotin-related proteins show for PD cases elevated levels of biotin transporters compared to healthy controls, suggesting a potential role of biotin metabolism in PD. Taken together, our findings identified the compensatory biotin pathway as a convergent, systemic driver of Mn toxicity and Parkinsonian pathology, providing a new basis for devising effective countermeasures against manganism and PD.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002223	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M88R7M			Trifluoroacetate reduces plasma lipid levels and the development of atherosclerosis in mice	Trifluoroacetate (TFA) has been assumed to be an innocuous counterion (to cationic amino acid side chains) present in countless synthetic bioactive peptides and a few FDA-approved therapeutics. We show here that TFA is in fact bioactive and causes dramatic biological effects in multiple strains of mice and cultured human and rat liver cells. In high-fat diet (HFD)-fed low-density lipoprotein receptor-null (LDLr-/-) mice, TFA reduces the levels of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and the development of atherosclerotic lesions following either oral or intraperitoneal administration. These physiological effects were observed with TFA alone, or with TFA present as a counterion of a variety of short, unrelated synthetic peptide sequences. Mechanistic investigations including RNA-seq, confocal microscopy, western blotting, metabolomics, proteomics, pharmacokinetics, and biochemical assays indicated that TFA induces peroxisome proliferation by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha. We confirmed that TFA also caused peroxisome proliferation and downstream phenotypic effects in cultured human and rat liver cells, wild-type C57/Bl mice, and apolipoprotein E-null (apoE-/-) mice, leading to anti-atherosclerotic effects in the latter strain. Given that TFA is a counterion in many peptides employed in early research and development settings, these findings raise the possibility that TFA may be confounding or contributing to phenotypic changes observed in many studies involving peptides. Although our studies suggest that TFA or its analogues might have therapeutic applications, it should be noted that TFA is also a persistent environmental contaminant that is found at high levels in humans relative to other polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and is a major metabolite following treatment of patients with common inhaled anesthetics, suggesting that the biological effects reported here could have other implications for human health.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002224	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M84Z5P			An Organism-Level Quantitative Flux Model of Energy Metabolism in Mice	Mammalian tissues feed on nutrients in the blood circulation. At the organism-level, mammalian energy metabolism comprises of oxidation, storage, interconverting, and releasing of circulating nutrients. Though much is known about the individual processes and nutrients, a holistic and quantitative model describing these processes for all major circulating nutrients is lacking. Here, by integrating isotope tracer infusion, mass spectrometry, and isotope gas analyzer measurement, we developed a framework to systematically quantify fluxes through these metabolic processes for 10 major circulating energy nutrients in mice, resulting in an organism-level quantitative flux model of energy metabolism. This model revealed in wildtype mice that circulating nutrients have more dominant metabolic cycling fluxes than their oxidation fluxes, with distinct partition between cycling and oxidation flux for individual circulating nutrients. Applications of this framework in obese mouse models showed on a per animal basis extensive elevation of metabolic cycling fluxes in ob/ob mice, but not in diet-induced obese mice. Thus, our framework describes quantitatively the functioning of energy metabolism at the organism-level, valuable for revealing new features of energy metabolism in physiological and disease conditions.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002228	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8MZ51			Metabolomic Insights of Cultured Meat	The growing demand for sustainable food sources has accelerated the development of cultured meat as an alternative to traditional meat products. This study aims to predict the safety and nutritional equivalence of cultured meat compared to conventional meat using a comprehensive metabolomics approach. In this study, we conducted a comparative metabolomic analysis of conventional chicken meat, muscle satellite cells, and differentiated cells. Our findings reveal that while the overall metabolic profiles of cultured and original meats are comparable, significant differences are observed in specific metabolites. Notably, metabolites associated with nutrient metabolism and synthesis display substantial variations among the samples. These differences suggest that the nutritional content of cultured meat may differ from that of traditional meat, potentially affecting its dietary value. Despite these differences in metabolic profiles, our analysis indicates that there is no significant impact on the safety of cultured meat itself. The safety of cultured meat remains within acceptable limits, and no adverse health risks were identified in the context of this study. However, the observed variations in nutrient-related metabolites highlight the need for further investigation to fully understand their implications. Our study contributes to the ongoing evaluation of cultured meat as a viable and safe alternative in the pursuit of sustainable food sources.

Here, we present a proof-of-concept study designed to unravel this challenging question. To this aim, we centrally administered leptin or ghrelin to male mice. Subsequently, we conducted microbiota composition analysis throughout the gut using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our results showed that these brain interventions significantly changed the gut microbiota in an anatomical and short-term (two to four hours) fashion. Metabolomics analysis was performed on the intestinal content of the duodenum 4h after leptin injection, revealing changed metabolite levels.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002231	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M87R79			Macrophages recycle phagocytosed bacteria to fuel immunometabolic responses	Macrophages specialize in phagocytosis, a cellular process that eliminates extracellular matter, including microbes, through internalization and degradation. Despite the critical role of phagocytosis during bacterial infection, the fate of phagocytosed microbial cargo and its impact on host cell is poorly understood. Here, we reveal that ingested bacteria constitute an alternative nutrient source that skews immunometabolic host responses. Tracing stable isotope-labelled bacteria, we found that phagolysosomal degradation of bacteria provides carbon atoms and amino acids that are recycled into various metabolic pathways, including glutathione and itaconate biosynthesis, and satisfy macrophage bioenergetic needs. Metabolic recycling of microbially-derived nutrients is regulated by the nutrient sensing mTORC1 and intricately tied to microbial viability. Dead bacteria, as opposed to live ones, are enriched in cyclic- adenosine monophosphate (AMP), sustain the cellular AMP pool and subsequently activate AMP protein kinase (AMPK) to inhibit mTORC1. Consequently, killed bacteria strongly fuel metabolic recycling and support macrophage survival, but elicit decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a reduced IL-1β secretion compared to viable bacteria. These results reveal a novel insight into the fate of engulfed microbes and highlights a microbial viability-associated metabolite that triggers host metabolic and immune responses. Our findings hold promise for shaping immunometabolic intervention in various immune-related pathologies.

While several studies explored the resistant biofilm formed by C. auris, little is known regarding the cells dispersed following biofilm formation. Herein, I investigated and characterized the cells dispersed from C. auris biofilms. Cells dispersed from biofilm developed in 96 well plate were isolated and counted. GC-MS analysis indicated that dispersed cells exhibit altered metabolic profile that enhance cells survivability under stress and nutrient limit condition. The presented study is the first to explore C. auris dispersed cells and indicated that they are not able to revert to the planktonic mode once released from the biofilm.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002233	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8082D			SLC7A5 is required for cancer cell growth in arginine-limited conditions	Tumor cells must optimize metabolite acquisition between synthesis and uptake from a microenvironment characterized by hypoxia, lactate accumulation, and depletion of many amino acids including arginine. We performed a metabolism-focused functional screen using CRISPR/Cas9 to identify pathways and factors that enable tumor growth in an arginine-depleted environment. Our screen identified the SLC-family transporter SLC7A5 as required for growth, and we hypothesized that this protein functions as a high-affinity citrulline transporter. Using metabolomics, we show that metabolism of citrulline into arginine are dependent upon expression of SLC7A5. Pharmacological inhibition of SLC7A5 blocks growth in low arginine conditions across a diverse group of cancer cell lines. Loss of SLC7A5 reduces tumor growth and citrulline import in a mouse tumor model. We identify a conditionally essential role for SLC7A5 in arginine metabolism, and we propose that SLC7A5-targeting therapeutic strategies in cancer may be effective in the context of arginine limitation.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002234	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8VJ9K			Kupffer cells control neonatal hepatic glucose metabolism via Igf1 signaling	During perinatal development, liver metabolism is tightly regulated to ensure energy supply for the newborn. Before birth, glycogen is stored in hepatocytes and later metabolized to glucose, meeting the energy demands of the neonate. Shortly after birth, lipogenesis begins, driven by the transcriptional activation of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation. These processes are thought to be largely regulated by systemic insulin and glucagon levels. However, the role of liver-derived local factors in neonatal hepatocyte metabolism remains unexplored. Kupffer cells (KCs), the liver’s resident macrophages, colonize the fetal liver early in embryogenesis and support liver metabolism in adulthood. Yet, whether KCs influence neonatal hepatocyte metabolism is unknown. Here, using conditional knockout mouse models targeting macrophages, we demonstrate that yolk sac-derived KCs play a critical role in hepatocyte glycogen storage and function by regulating the TCA cycle - a role that monocyte-derived KC-like cells cannot substitute. Newborn pups lacking KCs mobilize glycogen more rapidly, a process regulated by insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) production. Our findings reveal that macrophages are a major source of Igf1 at birth and that local Igf1 production by KCs is essential for balanced hepatocyte metabolism.

We here describe that obesity and weight loss in male mice causes reversible abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism, serum metabolomes, and white adipose tissue alongside reversible reductions in activity of genes controlling mitochondrial energy dissipation. When mating obese male mice with lean females, we observed concordant reductions in mitochondrial gene expression and translation in offspring that resemble those observed in the paternal (F0) generation. When mapping miRNA responses across somatic and gametic cell types and generations, we found that obesity and weight loss reversible affected miRNA abundance, and observed miR-let7 isoforms induced in obese adipose tissues of F0 and offspring (F1) generations, as well as in sperm of obese F0 mice. Mechanistically, when overexpressing miR-let-7 in adipocytes, we found it to silence DICER1, a cellular rheostat required for adipose tissue adaptation in obesity as evidenced by functional deficiency in mitochondrial functioon following DICER1 loss. Delivery of miR-let-7 into oocytes elicited glucose intolerance and impairments in adipose mitochondrial gene expression in mice sired from miRNA-injected embryos, phenocopying aspects of paternal obesity. When performing single-cell RNA-Seq of embryos, we found that miR-let7 impaired mitochondrial gene expression, suggesting altered energy metabolism following sperm-mediated changes in zygotic miRNAs. When studying miRNA alterations in human semen, we lifestyle-induced weight loss to downregulate MIR-LET-7 in human subjects, suggesting similar roles for human MIR-LET-7 in gametic epigenomes and embryogenesis.

PPGRs to the same foods have been shown to vary between individuals, but the systematic characterization of the underlying physiologic and molecular basis is lacking. We measured PPGRs using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in 55 well-phenotyped participants challenged with seven different carbohydrates administered in replicate under standardized conditions. We also measured the effects of preloading a rice meal with fiber, protein, or fat (“mitigators”). To examine the physiologic and molecular basis for inter-individual PPGR differences, we performed gold-standard metabolic tests and multi-omics profiling. We discovered: 1. Postprandial glycemic responses (PPGRs) to different standardized carbohydrate meals vary between individuals. 2. Individuals’ PPGRs are associated with their metabolic phenotypes, including insulin resistance. 3. Individual’s PPGRs can be reduced in magnitude and delayed by premeal mitigators which is associated with their metabolic phenotypes. 4. Individuals can be stratified by their PPGRs to different carbohydrate meals, and PPGR subtypes have distinct metabolic profiles and multi-omics patterns. 5. Individuals’ metabolic phenotype can be inferred from both food-specific PPGRs and baseline omics.

Hypersalinity is known to trigger diapause in brine shrimp, a reproductive strategy for survival in extreme environments. To elucidate the metabolic responses associated with hypersalinity-induced oviparity, we analyzed brine shrimp samples exposed to normal salinity (30 parts per thousand) and high salinity (80 parts per thousand) conditions. The extracted metabolites were analyzed using a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer, and metabolites were identified and quantified using Chenomx Profiler and the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB).
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002247	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M85V6B			Untargeted NMR-metabolomic study in NIH3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblasts)	Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPS) is a highly conserved enzyme that conducts the chokepoint reaction of nucleotide biosynthesis by converting ribose-5-phosphate (R-5-P) to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP). Due to the presence of multiple isoforms and related PRPS-associated proteins in opisthokont species, the precise nature of the PRPS enzyme in cells and tissues remains uncertain. Using proteomics approaches and biochemistry in mammalian cells, we demonstrate that these individual components assemble together to form a heterogeneous megadalton complex comprising of PRPS1 (P1), PRPS2 (P2), and two PRPS associated proteins – PRPSAP1 (AP1) and PRPSAP2 (AP2). Employing CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (KO) strategy in NIH3T3 cells (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) to generate all viable genetic knockout combinations, we observed that PRPS1-only expressing cells (P2/AP1/AP2 triple KO) has severe cellular proliferation defects as compared to other knockout lines. To pinpoint the metabolic basis for decreased proliferative capacity of PRPS1-only expressing cells (P2/AP1/AP2 KO), we used NMR based 13C isotopic tracing to compare the metabolic state of wildtype and P2/AP1/AP2 KO NIH3T3 cells. The results demonstrate that P2/AP1/AP2 KO cells exhibit reduced pentose phosphate pathway flux and nucleotide production, alongside alterations in glycolysis, the creatine phosphate pathway, and choline metabolism. These changes reflect decreased PRPP synthesis rates, likely due to suboptimal PRPS1 homotypic configurations. Collectively, this study revealed that PRPS1 as a standalone enzyme in cells is insufficient to sustain the metabolic flux necessary to keep up with the demands of proliferation.

In Pfa1 cells, ferroptosis is induced upon treatment with tamoxifen which induces knock-out of GPX4, causing massive ferroptosis. Ferroptosis, in turn, was rescued using lipid ros scavenger FER-1 (Ferrostatin1).

The molecular mechanisms facilitating cellular adaptation to these stimuli remain largely elusive. Employing a multi-omics approach, we discovered that hypoxic and glucose-deprived cancer cells enter a quiescent state supported by mitophagy, fatty acid β-oxidation, and amino acid catabolism, concurrently enhancing their invasive capabilities. Reoxygenation and glucose restoration efficiently reversed cell quiescence without affecting cellular viability, highlighting significant molecular plasticity in adapting to microenvironmental challenges. Furthermore, cancer cells exhibited substantial perturbation of protein O-glycosylation, leading to simplified glycophenotypes with shorter glycosidic chains. Exploiting glycoengineered cell models, we established that immature glycosylation contributes to reduced cell proliferation and increased invasion. Our findings collectively indicate that hypoxia and glucose deprivation trigger cancer aggressiveness, reflecting an adaptive escape mechanism underpinned by altered metabolism and protein glycosylation, providing grounds for clinical intervention.

In Plasmodium falciparum, UDP-GlcNAc is synthesized via the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and is essential for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor production, the most prominent form of protein glycosylation in this parasite. In this study, we explore a conditional knockout of glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (PfGNA1), a key HBP enzyme. PfGNA1 depletion led to significant disruptions in HBP metabolites, impairing GPI biosynthesis and causing mislocalization of the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1), the most abundant GPI-anchored protein in the parasite. As a result, parasites were arrested at the schizont stage, exhibiting severe segmentation defects and an incomplete rupture of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM), preventing egress from host red blood cells. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of HBP and GPI biosynthesis in P. falciparum asexual development and underscore the potential of targeting these pathways as a therapeutic strategy against malaria.

Thus, Metabolite analysis was conducted to detect the content of flavonoid in WT (Wild-type), OE (BnaA09.MYB52 overexpression lines in the genetic background Westar) and mutants (four homologous genes of BnaMYB52 knocked out) plants. The result showed that the content of several metabolites in flavonoid pathway was reduced in mutants, whereas overexpression lines resulted in the opposite trend compared with WT.

Here, we developed inducible whole-body Acly knockout mice to determine the requirement for ACLY in normal tissue functions, uncovering its crucial role in skin homeostasis. ACLY-deficient skin upregulates the acetyl-CoA synthetase ACSS2; deletion of both Acly and Acss2 from the skin exacerbates skin abnormalities, with differential effects on two major lipid-producing skin compartments. While the epidermis is depleted of barrier lipids, the sebaceous glands increase production of sebum, supplied at least in part by circulating fatty acids and coinciding with adipose lipolysis and fat depletion. Dietary fat supplementation further boosts sebum production and partially rescues both the lipoatrophy and aberrant skin phenotypes. The data establish a critical role for cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis in maintaining skin barrier integrity and highlight the skin as a key organ in systemic lipid regulation.

Consequently, the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies becomes a critical clinical imperative. Among the genetic alterations contributing to PDAC, c-MYC (an oncogenic transcription factor) overexpression arises due to upstream mutations, amplifications, and copy number alterations. c-MYC serves as a key regulator in the tumor's metabolic reprogramming, playing a pivotal role in proliferation, migration, and metastasis. This study delves into the investigation of the role of the elongase ELOVL6 in c-MYC-induced cell transformation and its potential as a therapeutic target in PDAC. Here, we demonstrate that c-MYC regulates lipid elongation to promote cell transformation, offering a new avenue for therapeutic intervention. Initially, we show the direct regulation of ELOVLs expression by c-MYC in various PDAC mouse models and cell lines, elucidating its upregulation during transformation and tumor progression. Genetic or chemical inhibition of ELOVL6 results in decreased proliferation and migration, accompanied by alterations in fatty acid elongation. These changes in fatty acid composition led to modifications in membrane rigidity, permeability, and thickness, which collectively affect micropinocytosis and macropinocytosis. Importantly, we observe an increase in Abraxane uptake and a synergistic effect when combined with ELOVL6 interference in vitro. In vivo validation demonstrates that ELOVL6 inhibition significantly reduces tumor growth and enhances the response to Abraxane, thereby increasing overall survival. Altogether, these results position ELOVL6 as a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of PDAC.

In this study, we have integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to better understand the role of the metabolic regulatory transcription factor ChREBP in coordinated regulation of key pathways of intermediary metabolism in the liver. We have uncovered regulatory effects of ChREBP on metabolic homeostasis beyond it’s historical role in control of core glucose and lipid metabolic pathways, to now include effects on co-factors, transporters for amino acids and other small molecules, nucleotide metabolism, and control of mitochondrial substrate supply.

Human adenoviruses overtake the DNA replication machinery of the infected host, rewiring mitotic events. Infection leads to the elevations in glucose and glutamine consumption rates, while also increasing lactate production rate. Fibroblast lineages are normally quiescent cells that display a repertoire of responses to certain agonists. Data on the shifts in fibroblast metabolism in response to human adenoviral infection are lacking. Specifically, knowledge pertaining to metabolic shifts aside from those involved in glycolytic metabolism after human adenoviral infection remains sparse. We used an untargeted metabolomic approach to better understand the dynamic metabolic changes to fibroblasts in response to 3 viral dosages, across 4 time points post-infection. Profound shifts were seen in cysteine, purine, and unsaturated fatty acid metabolites. This analysis provides a global perspective and highlights previously underappreciated aspects of how human adenovirus alters host metabolism.

However, recent clinical studies suggested increased proliferation and fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) in a subgroup of breast cancer (BC) patients after metformin therapy. Considering that FAO can activate Src kinase in aggressive triple-negative BC (TNBC), we hypothesized that a low-dose biguanides-driven AMPK-ACC-FAO signaling may activate the Src pathway in TNBC. The low bioavailability of metformin in TNBC xenografts mimicked metformin's in vitro low-dose effect. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of FAO significantly enhanced the anti-tumor properties of biguanides. Lower doses of biguanides induced and higher doses suppressed Src signaling. Dasatinib and metformin synergistically inhibited TNBC patient-derived xenograft growth but not in high-fat diet-fed mice. This combination also suppressed TNBC metastatic progression. A combination of biguanides with Src inhibitors provides synergy to target metastatic TNBC suffering with limited treatment options.

Yet, the small labile molecules (metabolites) responsible for maintaining these ODZ communities are unknown. Here, we compared the metabolome of an ODZ to that of an oxygenated site by quantifying 87 metabolites across depth profiles in the eastern tropical North Pacific ODZ and the oxygenated waters of the North Pacific Gyre. We further use transcriptomes to identify taxa involved in production and subsequent transformation of glycine betaine (GBT), a metabolite we suggest is involved in microbial interdependencies in this community, and elsewhere in the ocean.

PNPLA6 is generally known to be an enzyme that degrades phospholipids in a calcium-independent manner, but its activity and substrates in the eye have not yet been elucidated. We focused on the function of PNPLA6, whose function in the retina is not well understood, and biochemically analyzed the mechanism by which retinal pigmentary degeneration occurs.

PPI-interfaces are predominantly conserved and hotspots for disease-related mutations. How do lipid-protein interactions (LPIs) constrain sequence evolution of membrane-PCs? We explore Respiratory Complexes (RCs) as a case study as these allow to compare sequence evolution in subunits exposed to both lipids in inner-mitochondrial membrane (IMM) and lipid-free aqueous matrix. We find that lipid-exposed surfaces of the IMM-subunits but not of the matrix subunits are populated with non-PPI disease-causing mutations signifying LPIs in stabilizing RCs. Further, IMM-subunits including their exposed surfaces show high intra-kingdom sequence conservation but remarkably diverge beyond. Molecular Dynamics simulation suggests contrasting LPIs of structurally superimposable but sequence-wise diverged IMM-exposed helices of Complex I (CI) subunit Ndufa1 from human and Arabidopsis depending on kingdom-specific unsaturation of cardiolipin fatty acyl chains. in cellulo assays consolidate inter-kingdom incompatibility of Ndufa1-helices due to the lipid-exposed amino acids. Plant-specific unsaturated fatty acids in human cells also trigger CI-instability. Taken together, we posit that altered LPIs calibrate sequence evolution at the IMM-arms of eukaryotic RCs.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002271	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M82V6D			Metabolome trajectory of exercise physiology- a comprehensive study of healthy male and female athletes	BACKGROUND. Integrating metabolomics in sports science provides valuable insights into the biochemistry during physical activity. However, due to their invasiveness, traditional blood sampling methods present challenges in sports settings. The study investigated sex-specific metabolic responses, addressing a significant gap in exercise research, where female participation remains underrepresented. METHODS. To address this, we explored volumetrically accurate microsampling (VAMS) as a dried blood spot (DBS) technique for assessing metabolomic changes in response to acute exercise in more than 130 participants. This study employed a targeted quantitative approach using isotopically-labeled internal standards to measure over 100 metabolites in DBS, providing accurate and traceable results. An accuracy assessment using standard reference material and stability testing over 90 days further evaluated the suitability of DBS for sports metabolomics. RESULTS. Our findings confirm that DBS offers a valid approach to capturing metabolic changes during exercise, reporting a wide panel of metabolites including key metabolites of energy pathways, which correlate well with plasma-derived data but also less studied classes such as pyrimidines. Implementing a straightforward standardization concept established metabolic perturbations upon bout exercise as differences of absolute concentrations. CONCLUSIONS. While metabolic regulations upon exercise are similar in both sexes, differences in the correlation with fitness-related metadata such as peak volitional oxygen consumption (V̇O2peak) and performance, indicate a higher complexity in women and a limitation of previous knowledge to men only. The quantification approach together with the simplicity of the sampling paves the way to expand this type of research towards other fields of personalized medical services.

However, it is difficult to isolate the effects of tumor nutrient stress from other suppressive factors. Thus, we employed a chemically-defined cell culture medium based on the metabolomic profile of TIF: Tumor Interstitial Fluid Medium (TIFM). Culture of CD8+ T cells in TIFM limited cell expansion and impaired CD8+ T cell effector functions upon restimulation, suggesting tumor nutrient stress alone is sufficient to drive T cell dysfunction. We identified phosphoethanolamine (pEtn), a phospholipid intermediate, as a driver of T cell dysfunction. pEtn dampened T Cell Receptor (TCR) signaling by depleting T cells of diacylglycerol required for TCR signal transduction. Reduction of pEtn accumulation in tumors improved intratumoral T cell function and tumor control, suggesting pEtn accumulation plays a dominant role in TME immunosuppression.

In this study, we employed untargeted lipidomics with iterative tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to profile the brain lipidome of Syrian hamsters across different hibernation stages: late torpor, arousal, and euthermia (control). Previously, a lipid species identified as methyl-PA(16:0/0:0) showed a significant increase during torpor, but its precise structure was unresolved due to technological constraints. Leveraging iterative MS/MS and advanced lipid annotation tools (LipidAnnotator and MS-DIAL), we accurately annotated 377 lipid species, including the re-identification of methyl-PA(16:0/0:0) as methylated lysophosphatidic acid (PMeOH 16:0/0:0). This reannotation led to the discovery of two additional lipids during torpor: PMeOH 18:0/0:0 and PMeOH 18:1/0:0. Verification involved manual inspection of MS/MS spectra and Kendrick Mass Defect plots. The lipid alterations observed during torpor suggest biochemical adaptations to maintain membrane fluidity and protect against oxidative stress under hypothermic conditions. Elevated levels of PMeOH lipids and their lyso-forms may play roles in cell survival signalling. Additionally, a decrease in phosphatidic acid species and an increase in diacylglycerol species imply a metabolic shift favouring diacylglycerol production, potentially activating protein kinase C signalling pathways. The increased levels of monogalactosyl diglyceride lipids during torpor suggest a role in neuroprotection by enhancing oligodendrocyte function and myelination. Our comprehensive lipidomic profiling provides detailed insights into lipid dynamics associated with hibernation and underscores the potential of advanced MS/MS methodologies in lipidomics for developing therapeutic strategies against neurodegenerative diseases.

This study employed 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics to investigate the biochemical responses of these animals to varying sub-maintenance nutritional states. Serum samples from 388 wild bighorn sheep collected between 2014 and 2017 during December through March across Wyoming and Montana were analyzed. Multivariate statistics and machine learning analyses were employed to identify characteristic metabolic patterns and metabolic interactions between early and severe sub-maintenance nutritional states. Significant differences were observed in the levels of 15 of the 49 quantified metabolites, including formate, thymine, glucose, choline, and others, pointing to disruptions in one-carbon, amino acid, and central carbon metabolic pathways. These metabolites may serve as indicators of critical physiological processes such as nutritional intake, immune function, energy metabolism, and protein catabolism, essential for understanding how wild bighorn sheep adapt to nutritional stress. The study has generated valuable insights into molecular networks underlying the metabolic resilience of wild bighorn sheep, highlighting the potential for using specific biochemical markers to evaluate nutritional and energetic states in free-ranging ungulates. These insights may help wildlife man-agers and ecologists compare populations across different times in seasonal cycles, providing information to assess the adequacy of seasonal ranges and support conservation efforts. This research strengthens our understanding of metabolic adaptations to envi-ronmental stressors in wild ruminants, offering a foundation for improving management practices to maintain healthy bighorn sheep populations.

Importantly, we demonstrate a causal relationship through microbiome transplantation into germ-free mice, whereby alterations in the gut microbiota were maintained in the absence of continued selective pressure from the KD. Specifically, we identify a shift toward bacterial species that produce stearic acid in ketogenic conditions, whereas consumers were depleted, resulting in elevated levels of free stearate in the gut lumen. This microbial product demonstrates tumor-suppressing properties by inducing apoptosis in cancer cells and decreasing colonic Th17 immune cell populations. As part of this study, we used different metabolomics workflows to study metabolites in mouse fecal and plasma samples as well as the used rodent diet.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002285	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M88G2Z			Adenosine Deaminase function in C. elegans	We have previously demonstrated that the C. elegans pnp-1 gene encodes a purine nucleoside phosphorylase that catalyzes the conversion of inosine to hypoxanthine. We hypothesize that the C. elegans adah-1 gene encodes the adenosine deaminase that acts upstream of PNP-1 to produce inosine from adenosine. To investigate the hypothesis that ADAH-1 functions as a canonical adenosine deaminase, we used RNAi to knockdown expression of ADAH-1, and used LC-MS to compare relative levels of adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine in the knockdown animals and an RNAi control (L4440). As a control we also confirmed the activity of pnp-1, by comparing levels of adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine in control (N2) and the loss of function mutant pnp-1(jy90). As expected we found that levels of hypoxanthine were reduced and levels of inosine were increased in pnp-1 mutants relative to control. In contrast, RNAi against adah-1 led to significantly increased levels of adenosine, and decreased levels of inosine and the downstream metabolite hypoxanthine. We conclude that ADAH-1 is a bona fide adenosine deaminase.

The clinical applicability of these findings, however, has been limited by: (i) plasma collection from a single anatomic site reflecting metabolic disturbances of the whole body rather than the pulmonary vessels, and (ii) the incomprehension of how metabolism relates to exercise physiology in PAH. We therefore aimed to quantify the transpulmonary (i.e., across the pulmonary vascular bed via two collection sites per patient per exercise timepoint) plasma metabolome in exercising connective tissue disease patients with suspected or confirmed PAH, with the goal of identifying metabolic signatures specific to the pulmonary vasculature and defining how they relate to physiologic, clinical parameters.

Here, the salivary metabolome of 965 children (7-17y) from 2 European countries was comprehensively analyzed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry providing &gt;3,500 untargeted features and 188 consistently detected metabolites. Correlation analysis with anthropometric, mental wellbeing, lifestyle and dietary data revealed that weight status and age reflected the salivary metabolome best, with functional analysis demonstrating alterations in multiple pathways. These findings were replicated in 2 validation cohorts involving 471 children (8-18y) confirming previously reported blood biomarkers and new molecules. For example, acesulfame K, an artificial sweetener detected in all cohorts, increased with weight and mental distress, while correlating to specific food/beverage consumption. Our data offer a high-quality repository of the pediatric salivary metabolome for providing guidance in exploring its association with children's health.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002293	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M87F9Z			Investigating the role of 4-diets through multi-organ and multi-omic crosstalk	Presently, dietary patterns have undergone significant shifts, and understanding the intricate interplay between diet, particularly high fat and high sucrose diets, the gut microbiome, and cardiometabolic health has become paramount. These dietary patterns have been consistently associated with heightened cardiometabolic risk factors including obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. High-fat diets, in particular, contribute to increased adiposity and ectopic fat deposition, exacerbating systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby promoting the development of metabolic dysfunction. Similarly, high sucrose diets have been implicated in the dysregulation of glucose homeostasis, leading to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, key hallmarks of cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Amidst this, the exploration of multi-omic profiles alongside the gut microbial landscape has emerged as a pivotal avenue for unraveling the complexities of cardiometabolic health dynamics affected by the effects of high-fat and high-sucrose diets. The approach of using a multi-omic comparison between organs offers a comprehensive lens through which the intricate molecular signatures underlying the impact of dietary compositions, particularly high fat and high sucrose, on metabolic health, can be examined.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002295	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8ZZ54			Impact of High Fat diet-induced MASLD on Heart, Kidney and Skeletal Muscle Metabolomes in Wild-type Mice	Excessive caloric intake is a primary driver of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and this has been recapitulated in mice fed a high-fat diet. In 2023, the global prevalence of MASLD was estimated at 30%, with high incidences affecting wealthy urbanised countries. This implication of hypercaloric diets can also perturb metabolism and function of extrahepatic tissues such as heart, kidney and skeletal muscle. These effects that can take place in extrahepatic tissues are still poorly understood in terms of metabolic alterations and physiology, and represent an important point of improvement in the knowledge gap that connects early stage MASLD with other obesity related comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, cardiovascular and renal complications, and overall, with the so known metabolic syndrome. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential of using metabolomics to unravel the effects and interactions taking place in a diet-induced MASLD model related to the development of the disorder. Black-6 mice were subjected to either a control diet or a high-fat diet for 18 weeks, from which at the end their heart, kidney and skeletal muscle metabolites were extracted. The metabolites, divided into aqueous and lipophilic fractions, were acquired by 1H-NMR, and then processed using a untargeted Metabolomics and Lipidomics analysis approach, to identify key changes occurring between control and high-fat diet in these models. These results added important information to better understand the link between early onset MASLD and the Metabolic Syndrome and its comorbidities, though several metabolic changes in the extrahepatic tissues, namely in ectopic fat deposition and alterations to Randle cycle and gut microbiota activity.

Perturbation of NAD metabolism is considered detrimental to health, with NAD depletion commonly thought to promote aging. However, the extent to which cellular NAD concentration can be decreased without deleterious repercussions is unclear. We generated a mouse model where nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis is disrupted in adult skeletal muscle. The resulting 85% decrease in muscle NAD+ abundance was associated with preserved tissue integrity and functionality, as demonstrated by its unchanged morphology, contractility, and exercise tolerance. This lack of defects was corroborated by intact mitochondrial respiratory capacity and unaffected muscle transcriptomic and proteomic profiles. Furthermore, lifelong NAD depletion did not accelerate muscle aging or impair whole-body metabolism. Collectively, these findings indicate that NAD depletion does not contribute to age related declines in skeletal muscle function. This submission contains lipidomics data.

Urban callus: Profiling of newly synthesized cryptic anthocyanins triggered by LED light exposure	In addition to the pentacyclic triterpenoid centelloids, Centella asiatica also synthesizes hydroxycinnamic acid conjugates as well as flavonoids. The latter is the major class of secondary plant metabolites and comprises of various subclasses, including anthocyanidins. Anthocyanins are rarely reported in extracts from C. asiatica and differ structurally due to a flavylium (2-phenylchromenylium) ion that carries a positive charge at the oxygen atom of the C-ring of the basic flavonoid structure. Callus of C. asiatica was initiated and propagated on synthetic media and subjected to different light regimes. White callus resulted from white fluorescent illumination, while purple callus developed in response to white light emitting diode (LED) illumination. In order to profile the metabolites responsible for the intense purple colouration, methanolic extracts were prepared from the two cell lines. Total phenolic, flavonoid and anthocyanin content were determined and indicated (i) very low levels of flavonoids and anthocyanins in white callus and (ii) that anthocyanins dominate the flavonoid content of the purple callus. Extracts were subjected to untargeted ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-definition mass spectrometry to profile newly synthesised anthocyanins. Metabolite annotation was based on accurate mass determination and characteristic fragmentation patterns. We report on the reprogramming of the metabolome of white C. asiatica callus due to LED illumination and profile the cryptic anthocyanins as well as putative flavonoid and caffeoylquinic acid co-pigments in purple callus.

Fecal and plasma samples collected one month before an international event underwent metagenomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic profiling. Metagenomic analysis via bioBakery tools revealed significant microbial pathways, including L-arginine biosynthesis III and fatty acid biosynthesis initiation. Key metabolic pathways, such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis; arginine biosynthesis; and folate biosynthesis, were enriched in both athlete groups. Plasma metabolomics and lipidomics revealed distinct metabolic profiles and a separation between athlete types through multivariate models, with lipid-related pathways such as lipid droplet formation and glycolipid synthesis driving the differences. Notably, elevated carnitine, amino acid, and glycerolipid levels in weightlifters suggest energy system-specific metabolic adaptations.

In Vibrio cholerae, (p)ppGpp metabolism is solely linked with the functions of three proteins: RelA, SpoT, and RelV. At threshold or elevated concentrations of (p)ppGpp, the level of cellular metabolites and proteins in the presence and absence of DksA in V. cholerae and other bacteria has not yet been comprehensively studied. We engineered the genome of V. cholerae to develop DksA null mutants in the presence and absence of (p)ppGpp biosynthetic enzymes. We observed a higher sensitivity of the (p)ppGpp0ΔdksA V. cholerae mutant to different ꞵ-lactam antibiotics compared to the wild-type (WT) strain. Our whole-cell metabolomic and proteome analysis revealed that the cell membrane and peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathways are significantly altered in the (p)ppGpp0, ΔdksA, and (p)ppGpp0ΔdksA V. cholerae strains. Further, the mutant strains displayed enhanced inner and outer membrane permeability in comparison to the WT strains. These results directly correlate with the tolerance and survival of V. cholerae to ꞵ-lactam antibiotics. These findings may help in the development of adjuvants for ꞵ-lactam antibiotics by inhibiting the functions of stringent response modulators.

These changes in nutrient availability impose metabolic constraints and perturb metabolic pathways in cancer cells, in contrast to cells in well-perfused tissues. Consequently, targeting the metabolic dependencies created by tumor microenvironmental constraints may be a promising antineoplastic therapeutic approach. To identify these adaptations, we challenged pancreatic cancer cell lines (mouse Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma - PDAC) with pathophysiological nutrient levels and analyzed changes to cell metabolism. Here, we report that arginine limitation in pancreatic cancer perturbs saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis by suppressing the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP1. Synthesis of these acyl species is critical to maintaining a balance of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids in cellular membranes. We found that, as a consequence of the loss of fatty acid synthesis, pancreatic cancer cells were unable to maintain balanced lipidomes when exposed to polyunsaturated fatty acids, leading to cell death by ferroptosis. Importantly, we found orally administering oils rich in polyunsaturated fats reduces tumor burden in mice with pancreatic cancer. In sum, this study illustrates that arginine restriction in the tumor microenvironment alters pancreatic cancer cells by perturbing lipid synthesis, making them sensitive to supplementation with polyunsaturated fats.

Monitoring these metabolic fluctuations is a central focus within the field of disease metabolomics. This study introduces an integrative analytical method that combines cross-comparative differential network analysis with network mapping to delineate the dynamic changes of diabetes rats in the fecal metabolome induced by high-fat diet and streptozotocin. Our results indicate that the fecal metabolite network is significantly associated with the development of diabetes, and 13 specific biomarkers are related to the progression of diabetic complications, namely galactose, lactose, guanidinoacetate, alanine, phenylalanine, acetoin, uridine, adenine, hypoxanthine, acetone, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), 1-methycotinamide and nicotinate. Interestingly, the networks analysis also uncovered age-related metabolites including branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine), urocanate, tyrosine, lysine succinate, betaine and cytosine, which may potentially promote the onset and progression of diabetes. Pathway analysis revealed disruptions in amino acid metabolism, ketone body synthesis and degradation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, galactose metabolism, nicotinamide metabolism, and purine metabolism, along with alterations in signaling pathways related to mineral absorption and neurotransmitter synaptic transmission. The cross-comparison network analysis in conjunction with network mapping analysis constitutes an effective method for exploring dynamic metabolic networks implicated in diseases pathogenesis.

Our understanding of the modified nucleoside profiles in Archaea, as well as the functions and dynamic regulation of specific RNA modifications is far from complete. Here, we established an extensive profile of nucleoside modifications in thermophilic and mesophilic Archaea through highly sensitive LC-MS/MS analysis and rigorous non-coding RNA depletion, identifying - with high confidence - at least four previously unannotated modifications in archaeal mRNAs. Nucleoside quantification analysis conducted on total, large, small, and mRNA-enriched subfractions of the model hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis revealed a series of modifications whose abundance is dynamically responsive to growth temperatures, implying that specific RNA modifications are fitness relevant under specific growth conditions. To predict the RNA-modifying enzymes most likely to generate the new and dynamic RNA modifications, we leveraged a bioinformatics analysis of open-access databases to annotate likely functional domains of archaeal proteins. Putative enzyme activities were confirmed in vitro and in vivo by assessing the presence of the target RNA modification in genetic deletion strains of T. kodakarensis. Our approach led to the discovery of a methyltransferase-encoded gene responsible for m7G modification in the P-loop of 23S rRNA peptidyl transferase center and validates a novel and effective platform for discovering RNA-modifying enzymes through LC-MS/MS analysis that will accelerate efforts of the community towards uncovering the complex and dynamic roles of RNA modifications.

CFTR is known to affect lipid metabolism and immune regulation. In this study, we employed untargeted lipidomics with iterative tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to characterize the differences in PANC-1 cells with different CFTR states (overexpression, empty vector, and mutations). Our study found that three PANC-1 cells carrying CFTR mutations (p.L88X, p.E681V, p.C1355Y) showed a significantly higher ratio of FA 20:4 (omega-6 PUFA) and FA 22:6 (omega-3 PUFA) compared to the CFTR wild-type (CFTR OE) PANC-1 cells. Among the arachidonoyl species, the compounds PC16:0_20:4 and PC18:0_20:4 showed higher normalized intensities in CFTR-mutated PANC-1 cells compared to CFTR OE. The compound PS18:0_20:4 exhibited a difference only between CFTR p.L88X PANC-1 cells and CFTR OE. The compounds PI16:0_20:4 and PI18:0_20:4 showed differences comparing CFTR p.L88X and p.C1355Y cells with CFTR OE. In the docosahexaenoyl species, the compounds PC18:0_22:6 and PI18:0_22:6 displayed higher normalized intensities in CFTR-mutated PANC-1 cells compared to CFTR OE. The compound PC16:0_22:6 exhibited differences comparing CFTR p.L88X and p.C1355Y cells with CFTR OE.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002322	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8GV64			The Chromosome-Scale Assembly and Multi-Omics Analysis Reveal Adaptive Evolution and Nitrogen Utilization Mechanisms in Edible Grass (Rumex patientia L.× Rumex tianschanicus A. LOS)	Edible grass (Rumex patientia L.× Rumex tianschanicus A. LOS), a perennial herbaceous plant from the Polygonaceae family, boasts a high protein content and rapid growth rate, making it a promising solution to feed shortages as a forage protein source. In this study, we utilized the PacBio sequencing platform and integrated methods including Hi-C to achieve a chromosomal-scale assembly of the R. patientia genome. The assembled genome spans 2.19 Gb with an N50 of 18.84 Mb, and 93.61% (2.05 Gb) of the assembly has been allocated to 30 pseudochromosomes. Comparative genomic analysis has revealed significant expansion of gene families involved in nitrogen metabolism and D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism pathways, which are responsible for the plant's strong nitrogen utilization capabilities and high protein content. Additionally, expansions in gene families associated with the Wnt signaling pathway, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, Toll and Imd signaling pathways, TGF-β signaling pathway, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, photosynthesis-antenna proteins, circadian rhythm, and cell cycle pathways are closely related to the rapid growth and development of R. patientia. We have also identified the rhizosphere microbiome of R. patientia and, by integrating metabolomic data from root tissues and soil, found that during rapid growth phases, the plant secretes various apigenin-like compounds into the soil, enhancing the symbiotic nitrogen-fixing capabilities and potentially providing nitrogen sources to the leaves through symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Our research provides crucial insights into the genetic basis of R. patientia 's utility as a forage protein source.
https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/	PR002329	http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M8KJ93			Hepato-cardiac interorgan communication controls cardiac hypertrophy via combined endocrine-autocrine FGF21 signaling.	Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) 21 is a hormone produced mainly by the liver but also other organs, including the heart. Although FGF21 analogs are used for treating obesity and metabolic syndrome in humans, preclinical and clinical studies have elicited mixed results about whether prolonged FGF21 signaling is protective or detrimental for cardiac function. Based on our findings, showing elevated serum and cardiac FGF21 levels in humans with increased left ventricular afterload, we explored involvement of FGF21 in cardiac hypertrophy. Our mouse studies revealed an interorgan liver-heart crosstalk mechanism which is controlled by initial hepatic FGF21 release followed by induction of cardiomyocyte FGF21 expression. Tissue-specific genetic ablation or anti-sense oligonucleotides-based inhibition of FGF21 showed that in response to pressure overload, cardiomyocyte FGF21 upregulation is a critical event that is stimulated by liver-derived FGF21 and drives cardiac hypertrophy likely by interfering with cardioprotective oxytocin signaling. Conclusively, a hepato-cardiac FGF21-based signaling axis governs cardiac hypertrophy.

To validate their enzymatic function, these genes were cloned into the Ycplac22 vector and introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae engineered to produce the necessary ODD substrate, taxadiene. The fermentation products were then analyzed using GC-MS to detect the formation of the target compound, 4β,20-taxadiene.
